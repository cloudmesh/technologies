\section{Dokku}
Dokku~\cite{hid-sp18-402-www-dokku} is a Platform as a Service (PaaS)
that runs on a single server which helps build and manage the
lifecycle of applications. It is powered by Docker and can be
installed on any hardware. Dokku requires minimum of 1GB memory and
Ubuntu 16.04 x64, Ubuntu 14.04 x64, Debian 8.2 x64 or CentOS 7 x64 for
the installation. It supports application deployment through
git. Technically Dokku is a set of scripts which combined as build
pipeline. It takes input as code and generates the running application. It
mostly is written in shell script and provides various features as
plugins, for example, config, storage etc.\ Dokku helps in easy code
deployment to the cloud so that developers can concentrate more on
application logic~\cite{hid-sp18-402-www-dokkuG}.
