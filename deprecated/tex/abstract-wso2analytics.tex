\section{WSO2 Analytics}

WSO2 Analytics is provided by the WSO2 Stream Processor. The features of the 
stream processor are support for stream and event processing contracts, user 
friendly development interfaces, high availability and scalability, easy 
integration with other components and business friendly analytics dashboards 
\cite{hid-sp18-416-www-wso2-stream-processor}. The stream processor is based on 
the Siddhi Processing engine~\cite{hid-sp18-416-github-siddhi} and is capable 
of  performing real-time analytics for different types of events. The query 
processing engine stays as the central component while the events pass through 
the engine. WSO2 drives the vision of digitizing businesses and analytics is a 
key part according to~\cite{hid-sp18-416-www-srinath-conference-talk}. The WSO2 
team emphasizes the need for analytics in businesses where automation and 
analytics is the highlight while taking the maximum use of contextual data
