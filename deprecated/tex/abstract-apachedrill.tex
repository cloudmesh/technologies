Apache Drill is an open-source framework for distributing 
computing on applications handling data-intensive analysis. 
It is the open-source parallel to Google Dremel for querying 
very large datasets. Drill is an Apache Top-Level~\cite{hid-sp18-404-BlogsApache2014} 
project which enables queries to process on many servers at once 
over multiple datastores. Drill supports many database systems 
including MongoDB, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google 
Cloud Storage~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Drill2015} and storage file 
formats including Parquet, JSON, CSV, and TSV in MapR-XD~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Drill2017}.
