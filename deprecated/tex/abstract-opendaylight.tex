OpenDaylight is an open source Software Defined Networks (SDN)
controller\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-opendaylight}. SDN separates network
control logic from physical networking equipment. The result is that
networking equipment is programmable like other computing
platforms. SDN facilitates Network Functions Virtualization (NFV),
allowing virtual network services (switching, virtualized appliances,
and virtualized applications) to be deployed without having to deploy
specialized physical devices\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-cio-sdn-nfv}. The
OpenDaylight project was founded by a group of large tech companies,
including Cisco, Citrix, Ericsson, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, Red Hat,
and VMware. Microsoft and VMware have since left the
project\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-sdx-odl}.
