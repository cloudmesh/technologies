\section{Kudu}

Apache Kudu was designed to fit into the Hadoop ecosystem and it 
serves as the storage layer that enables fast analytics on fast 
data~\cite{hid-sp18-517-ApacheKudu}.

Kudu internally follows the columnar storage approach rather than 
storing data in rows. This columnar approach helps in efficient 
encoding and compression. Kudu serves as a good alternative to HDFS 
and Apache HBase. It works best especially with use cases that 
require fast analytics on fast data. It is also efficient and 
designed to take advantage of next generation hardware and 
in-memory processing~\cite{hid-sp18-517-ApacheKudu}.
