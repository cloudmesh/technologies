Pig is a part of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem consisting of a scripting
language called Pig Latin and a compiler that produces Map-Reduce
programs. It was initially developed in 2006 at Yahoo! and taken over
by Apache in 2007\cite{hid-sp18-419-die2015datascience}. Pig Latin
allows developers to code multiple interrelated data transformations
as data flow sequences, with the goal fo making the code readable and
easy to maintain. Pig optimized Pig Latin automatically and users can
extend the language with purpose-written
functions\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-pig}. There is some overlap in
functionality between Pig and Hive, an SQL-like language that is also
a part of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. Pig tends to be favored by
programmers and researchers, whereas Hive is preferred by data
analysts\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-dezyre-pig}.
