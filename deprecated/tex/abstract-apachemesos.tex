Apache Mesos is the distributed systems kernel 
built similarly to the Linux kernel, but runs 
on a different level~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Apache2018}. 
Apache Mesos performs container and support and 
massively scalable data support by splitting 
scheduling into a two-level architecture. 
Applications running on Mesos are containerized separately 
from the framework handling infrastructure scheduling 
operations~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Mesos2018}.
