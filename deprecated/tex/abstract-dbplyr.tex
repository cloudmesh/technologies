DBPlyr is the bridge between R's immensly popular tidyverse, and the
DBI data connection family~\cite{hid-sp18-403-tidy-dbplyr}. The package allows
tables on remote or local databases, regardless of backend, to be
treated as first-class data structures in R. It does this by
procedurally generating (ususally SQL) queries for the databases on
the fly~\cite{hid-sp18-403-R-dbplyr}. While the data semantics are
agnostic (all data structures are treated the same, regardless of
provenance), dbplyr is aware of the limitations of different systems,
and will adjust its queries accordingly. Further, dbplyr will evaluate
queries lazily, meaning that almost no data is transferred into local
memory until it is explicitly asked for.
