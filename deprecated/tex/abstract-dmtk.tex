Distributed Machine Learning Tool Kit, or otherwise known as DMTK~\cite{hid-sp18-504-dmtk},
is a scalable collection of distributed machine learning algorithms
capable of training models on big data sets for increased accuracy.
This collection of ML algorithms and computational resources is managed,
and has new content added, by Microsoft. The existing DMTK product includes
a DMTK Framework for a `unified interfaces for data parallelization,
hybrid data structure for big model storage, model scheduling for big model
training, and automatic piplelining for high training efficiency'~\cite{hid-sp18-504-dmtk}.
DMTK also includes LightLDA (a topic model algorithm), Distribued
Word Embedding, and Light GBM (a gradient-boosting tree framework).
Developers are also able to utliize the framework for their own custom
ML algorithms~\cite{hid-sp18-504-dmtk}. Microsoft has made DMTK open
source to encourange  ML practitioners and researchers to make contributions
to the toolkit~\cite{hid-sp18-504-msresearch}.

DMTK's system innovations regarding its computational resources
allow for users to run big data/model algorithms with increased
performance. An example of `a topic model with one million topics
and a 20-million word vocabulary, or a word-embedding model with
1000 dimensions and a 20-million word vocabulary, on a web document
collection with 200 billion tokens' would take a machine cluster of
24 machines as opposed to using thousands~\cite{hid-sp18-504-msresearch}.
Capabilities extend beyond just topic modeling and cover various
machine learning complex tasks such as speech recognition and
computer vision~\cite{hid-sp18-504-msresearch}.
