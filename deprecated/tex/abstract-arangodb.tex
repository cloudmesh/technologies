\section{ArangoDB}

ArangoDB is a NoSQL database system used to support multiple data models against
a single backend engine. ArangoDB supports three main models which are key-value
pair, document and graph. Compared to MongoDB, which is a document oriented
database, ArangoDB has added benefits such as scalability, lower operation
costs, supporting JOINs and complex transactions
\cite{hid-sp18-416-www-arangodb}. ArangoDB used its' own query language AQL,
which is similar to SQL,
but has the benefit of querying a schema free database
\cite{hid-sp18-416-www-aql-blog}. ArangoDB provides flexibility in terms of
querying the data because
AQL can be used to query across all supported data models. This ease of use in
ArangoDB allows developers to represent the components of their systems by
models that are much more suitable. This is the reason for the gain in
popularity for native multi-model databases such as ArangoDB
