Apache Curator framework initially developed
by NetFlix. In July 2007 this framework has 
been open sourced to GitHub.

Apache Curator is a collection of Java 
based client libraries for
Apache Zookeeper, a centralized distributed
service~\cite{hid-sp18-514-apachecurator}

It includes a high level API framework and utilities 
to make using Apache Zookeeper much easier
and more reliable.It also includes recipes 
for common use cases and
extensions such as service discovery 
and a Java 8 asynchronous
DSL~\cite{hid-sp18-514-apachecurator}.  

The Curator framework consists of set of API's 
that prominently streamline using Zookeeper.  
This framework adds various 
features that build on Zookeeper and handles
the complexity of managing connections to the 
Zookeeper cluster in the distributed 
environment and retry operations.
The benefits of curator framework are:
Automatic connectionmanagement, 
Cleaner API, Recipe
implementations~\cite{hid-sp18-514-apachecuratorfeatures}.

The Apache curator RPC Proxy gives an access to
non Java Virtual Machine languages or environments.
Organizations can can unify the ZooKeeper usage across
the environmets.

Nirmata workflow is a Apache ZooKeeper service
and Apache Curator based library that enables
disributed task workflows in the enterprise
environments.This service can model simpe to 
complex relationships, mange tasks relationships
and distributed job scheduling, it is a simple API,
supports run time cluster changes with out service 
interruption. By default it supports high availability
and disater recovery and no signle point of failure in
the enterprise~\cite{hid-sp18-514-nirmataCurator}
