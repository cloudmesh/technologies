Mesosphere is an Datacenter Operating Platform for 
data-intensive applications. It is based on the Apache Mesos 
kernel~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Concepts2018}. It is a top-level 
cluster, manager, container platform and operating system~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Features2018}. 
Mesosphere performs resource consolidation, resource isolation, 
and storage capabilities in a scalable system as it runs distributed 
containerized software. It is agnostic to the infrastructure level, 
and so can be run on either physical or virtual machines~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Architecture2018}. 
Mesosphere incorporates\footnote{Please can you elaborate?} with Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
