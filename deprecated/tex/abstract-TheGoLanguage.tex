\section{The GO Programming Language}

Go is an open source programming language developed by team of
Google Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. Its easy to
build simple, robust and efficient software. Go is clean and
concise which directly compiles to machine code and has very
efficeient garbage collection mechanism. 

It has been built to support concurrency mechanism for multiple
proccesses to run inside a core efficiently. GOROUTINES, SELECT
and CHANNELS are some primitive types like String in Java which
are built around concurrent programming to solve complex problems.

Go is a cross platform and portable language which avoids several
object oriented features like classes and inheritence which might
not be suitable for multi-core processing and parallel computing.

Due to advent of big data technologies and cloud computing there
had been a need of modern programming language which could address
the efficiency and scalability requirements for these platforms.
Go works really well in modern computing environment due to its
really powerful and efficient dependency managment built inside it
which differentiates it from other languages like Java and C++.

Key features of GO Language are:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Ease of construction 
   \item High efficiency in working on large programs
   \item Many proggmers can work on a code
   \item Concurrency
   \item Dependency management  
\end{itemize}~\cite{hid-sp18-522-golanguage}
