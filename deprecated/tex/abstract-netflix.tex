Netflix offers a big-data platform that has both data and services that can be
used to access data as well as processing tools (algorithms) that can be used
to analyze data.  For example, Netflix's platform has tools that can be used to
detect outliers in large data sets~\cite{hid-sp18-505-Wong2015}.  Netflix's data sets can be
consumed and analyzed with their platform analytical tools or the tools can be
used independently on other non-Netflix data sets~\cite{hid-sp18-505-Netflix2018}.
