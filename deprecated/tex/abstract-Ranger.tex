Apache Ranger\cite{hid-sp18-515-www-ranger} is a framework to enable, 
monitor and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop 
platform.
In order to provide comprehensive security across the Apapche Hadoop 
ecosystem, the vision with Ranger was designed.
The Hadoop platform can now support a true data lake architecture with
the advent of Apache YARN.
In a multitenant environment, Enterprises can potentially run multiple 
workloads.
Data security within Hadoop needs to evolve to support multiple use cases 
for data access, while also providing a framework for central 
administration of security policies and monitoring of user access.
Please read the FAQs if you need to understand how it works over 
Apache Hadoop components.
The followings are goals of Apache Ranger:
1. Using a central UI or using REST APIs to centralize security 
administration to manage all security related tasks.
2. Use Hadoop components/tools to perform fine-grained authorization 
of specific operations and/or operations and manage them through 
central management tools.
3. Make sure that all Hadoop components authorization method are standardized.
4. Enhanced support for different authorization methods, such as 
role-based access control, attribute-based access control, etc.
5. Centrally audit user access and management operations 
(security-related) in all Hadoop components.
