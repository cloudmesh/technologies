OpenVZ is a container-based virtualization for Linux~\cite{www-openvz}.
OpenVZ is mainly composed of three parts: the kernel, an set of tools
and operating system templates.

OpenVZ applies to many places, including server consolidation, hosting,
development and testing, security and education~\cite{www-openvz-intro}. 
If you have a lot of Linux servers that are not being fully utilized, 
OpenVZ can be used to integrate them into a few (or possibly one) 
physical machines. However, OpenVZ is completely command-oriented 
and currently does not include any GUI-based applications. It may not
be suitable for those who are afraid of a shell prompt.
