\section{Owncloud}

OwnCloud has made its significant impact in providing client-server software
services for creating file hosting services and also to use them. Even though
most of the functionalities are comparable to Dropbox, OwnCloud distinguishes
itself by presenting as an open-source and free server edition. OwnCloud is
easily available which makes any user easy to install and operate it.

OwnCloud is putting its best efforts to make it work like Google Drive,
providing features such as online document editing, and contact
synchronization~\cite{hid-sp18-406-Owncloud}.
