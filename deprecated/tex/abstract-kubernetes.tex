Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying,
scaling, and operating application containers. ``The name Kubernetes
originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot, and is the root of
governor and cybernetic''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-Kubernetes}.
Kubernetes is capable of scheduling and running application containers
on both physical or virtual clusters. Kubernetes allows developers to
design applications that are agnostic of underlying architecture and
allows developers to design applications based on a container-centric
infrastructure rather than host-centric infrastructure, utilizing the
full advantages and benefits of
containers~\cite{hid-sp18-510-med-Kubernetes}. Kubernetes via its
building blocks (primitives) provides mechanism for easily deploying,
maintaining, and scaling applications. Underlying architecture of
Kubernetes is meant to be loosely coupled and extensible so that it
can be used across a wide variety of
workloads~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Kubernetes}.
