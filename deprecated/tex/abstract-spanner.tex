``Cloud Spanner is the enterprise-grade, globally-distributed database 
service built for the cloud''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner}. 
This technology combines the benefits of relational database structure 
with non-relational horizontal scale. ``This is unique combination that 
delivers high-performance transactions and strong consistency across rows, 
regions, and continents with high availability and enterprise-grade 
security''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner}. Cloud Spanner 
revolutionizes database administration and management and makes 
application development more efficient~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner}.
``It is fully managed, can be easily deployed and has built in synchronous 
replication and maintenance feature''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner}. 
It takes advantages of all critical features of relational databaseâ€”such 
as schemas, ACID transactions, and SQL queries (ANSI 2011) thus reducing 
the need of high learning curve for developers who are well proficient in 
structured query language. 
``Client libraries that can connect to spanner is language independent. 
These libraries can be developed in C sharp, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, 
and Ruby. Already existing JDBC driver with popular third-party tools can be 
used to connect with spanner''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner}. It is 
purposely built for global transactional consistency.
