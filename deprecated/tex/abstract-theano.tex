Theano is a numerical computation library built for Python programming
language. Theano uses Numpy syntax for expressing computations that
can be compiled to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU
architectures. Theano is an open source project and most of the
development is primarily contributed by a machine learning group at
the Universit\'{e} de Montr\'{e}al~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-theano}. Theano is
a Python library that allows developers to efficiently define,
optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions including
multi-dimensional arrays. Some of the features of Theano include tight
integration with NumPy, transparent use of a GPU to perform data
intensive computations, dynamic C code generation for evaluating
expressions faster and support for extensive unit testing and
self-verification~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-theano}.
