Oracle NoSQL Database\cite{hid-sp18-515-www-oraclenosql} is a scalable, 
distributed NoSQL database, designed to provide highly reliable, flexible 
and available data management across a configurable set of storage nodes.
Data in Oracle NoSQL Database can be modeled as both relational-database-style 
tables, JSON documents or key-value pairs.
Based on the hashed value of the primary key, Oracle NoSQL Database is 
a sharded s (shared-nothing) system which distributes the data uniformly 
across the multiple shards in the cluster.
Storage nodes are replicated to ensure high availability, rapid failover 
in the event of a node failure and optimal load balancing of queries
within each shard. 
NoSQL Database provides Java, C, Python and Node.js drivers and a 
REST API to simplify application development.
A wide variety of related Oracle and open source applications are 
integrated in Oracle NoSQL Database, in order to simplify and streamline 
the development and deployment of modern big data applications.
Oracle NoSQL Database is available in the following editions: 
Enterprise Edition - Oracle Commercial License
Basic Edition * - Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Commercial 
License
Community Edition - Open source license.
