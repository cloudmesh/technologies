JavaScript is a ubiquitous programming language with an
enormous number of uses. It is best known as the language
used to createweb pages\cite{hid-sp18-525-java}. However, its 
uses are far more than would appear. JavaScript is a flexible 
language that can function as object oriented, as well as 
procedural\cite{hid-sp18-525-java}. JavaScript has had a storied 
past\cite{hid-sp18-525-java}. Because of the universal adoption 
of JavaScript, it has a bright future. JavaScript is not 
confined to rendering web content. As an object-oriented 
language, JavaScript has unlimited potential as a 
programming platform\cite{hid-sp18-525-java}.
