Openchain is a blockchain ledger technology designed to be built in
seconds and deployed on an enterprise scale for the purposes of
managing asset transactions. The Openchain technology uses a
distributed client-server architecture rather than the slower
peer-to-peer proof of work concept originally adopted by early
blockchain technologies, most notably: Bitcoin. Openchain can serve as
a stand alone ledger or can be scaled as a side-ledger to existing
blockchain platforms~\cite{hid-sp18-507-Openchain}. Openchain's parent
company, Coinprism, has proven technology projects adopted by multiple
large-scale companies like the Open Asset technology used by
NASDAQ~\cite{hid-sp18-507-BitcoinNews}. Openchain is capable of
handling any type of digital asset such as gift cards, legal
documents, contracts, coins or tokens, or client-specific asset data
and this is done through the enacting company serving as its own
administrator by creating and enforcing it's own trust-approver
validation hierarchy~\cite{hid-sp18-507-Coindesk}.
