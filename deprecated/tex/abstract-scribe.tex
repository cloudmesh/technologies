Scribe is a server design, originally developed and maintained by
Facebook in 2008, that serves as an aggregation service for streaming
log data. The Scribe server is deployed within each node of a network
and sends the aggregated log data to a central server for
analysis. The data is interpreted by the Scribe servers via a
two-string input by a client: the category or direction, and the
message itself. Scribe has been deployed on thousands of servers on a
single network and is robust to network errors and
failures~\cite{hid-sp18-507-FBScribe}. Scribe was developed by
Facebook to prevent their highly distributed server architecture being
locked into a third party's network topology. The purpose of Scribe is
to solve two major needs of a distributed data system: capturing
events, changes, and errors on the system, and maintaining the
collected and aggregated data through issues common to decentralized
networks such as connection breaks, server downtime, and
scalability~\cite{hid-sp18-507-ScribeNote}. The logging-functionality
of Scribe is now maintained and improved upon through the open source
community. Scribe is available via the Apache License v.2.
