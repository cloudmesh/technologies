GitHub is a software management platform that offers free and fee-based
services that can be used for managing source code for software projects.
However, GitHub also offers an API through its Developer site.  The API
can be used to analyze a large body of data that is stored at GitHub.  The
data can be used to provide insight into trending software technologies, data
sources that pertain to non-software management domains.  For example, the
GitHub resource OpenRefine~\cite{hid-sp18-505-OpenRefine2018} is a reference
to a variety of data sources that are open for public use~\cite{hid-sp18-505-GitHub2018}.
