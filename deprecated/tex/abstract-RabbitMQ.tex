RabbitMQ technology is open source message broker, which supports multiple
messaging protocols. It has many features such as asynchronous messaging,
which supports message queuing, receive and deliver acknowledgments, routing
any message queues with broadcasting to logs or messages to multiple users.
``A RabbitMQ broker is a logical grouping of one or
several Erlang nodes, each running the RabbitMQ application and sharing users,
virtual hosts, queues, exchanges, bindings, and runtime parameters. Sometimes
we refer to the collection of nodes as a 
cluster''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQCluster}.
``RabbitMQ has pluggable support for various SASL authentication mechanisms.
Among many, with PLAIN authentication, its enabled by default in the RabbitMQ
server and clients''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQauth}.
``It was originally implemented Advance Message Queuing Protocoland has been
extended to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol and other
protocols''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQwiki}.
``The rabbitmq-management plugin provides an HTTP-based API for management and
monitoring of your RabbitMQ server, along with a browser-based UI and a
command line tool, rabbitmqadmin''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQmana}.
