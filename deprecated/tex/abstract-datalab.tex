Cloud Datalab~\cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab} is an open source tool 
part of the Google Cloud Platform suite which focuses on delivering
analytic, machine learning and visualization solutions. Fully integrated
with the Google Platform Suite, Datalab can leverage the data stored in
various other Google solutions ranging from BigQuery and Machine Learning
Engine to Compute Engine and Cloud Storage~\cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab}.
In addition to this integration, Cloud Datalab delivers a solution for
developers to generate reports after exploring, transforming, and visualizing
data using Python, SQL, and Javascript. Visualizations are primarily
derived from sources such as Google Charting or matplotlib~\cite{hid-sp18-504-techcrunch-datalab}.

Based on Jupyter~\cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab}, Datalab utlizes the
existing platform community and supports a `large number of existing packages
for statistics, machine learning etc'~\cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab}.
Developers can also extend this open source software by forking it.
However, it should be noted that although this is an open source product
and is free, cost is a factor once this is deployed as an
App Engine application and cloud services are utilized~\cite{hid-sp18-504-techcrunch-datalab}.
