Apache Phoenix\cite{hid-sp18-526-www-apache-phoenix} is an open-source
database engine by Apache that works in tandem with Hadoop and HBase. Because
it uses HBase, Phoenix is a noSQL store. The system supports online
transaction processing (OLTP). Using SQL and Java database connectivity
(JDBC), Phoenix allows for queries over millions of rows to be executed in
milliseconds. Phoenix overlays HBase and allows data to be accessed directly
via SQL queries (through JDBC). It allows for indexing and parallelization
to greatly reduce query time. Phoenix is compatible with the host of Hadoop
products such as Spark, Hive, and MapReduce. Phoenix allows table modifications
through DDL (Data Definition Language) commands. These commands use simple
SQL statements to create or alter tables. Phoenix also uses ACID (Atomicity,
Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.

In order to begin using Phoenix, you must first install java and download
the Phoenix jar file. Phoenix is currently used by many large corporations
such as eBay, Salesforce, and Bloomberg.
