Clive is an open-source, distributed operating system written in Go by
the Laboratorio De Sistemas at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in
Madrid~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-clive-lsub}. The design goal is to create
an environment where applications and services can be compiled along
with libraries that permit them to run on bare hardware without a
software stack~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-clive-lsub2014}. The design is
based on Plan 9, a research system developed at Bell
Labs in the late 1980s and first released in
1992\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-about-plan9}, and NIX, a
``purely functional package manager''~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-about-nix}
derived from Plan 9 that runs on Linux and Mac OS X.
