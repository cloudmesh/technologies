``H20 is a open source platform that can execute highly advanced 
and complex machine learning algorithms in faster and scalable 
way,regardless of the size, format and location of the 
data''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-h2o}. ``It achieves this by serializing 
the data faster between nodes and clusters that stores huge amount 
of data. Data processing is done in memory thus providing faster 
response''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-h2o}.``It uses fine grain parallelism 
technique for processing of distributed data archiving 100x faster 
speed as compared to traditional mapreduce without compromising 
on accuracy''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-h2o}. H2O4GPU, Sparking Water
and driverless AI are popular products of H2O. Many companies
across different domain such as banks, insurance, online sales 
are using H2O platform for their machine learning and AI related
research.
