\section{Teradata Kylo}

Kylo is a data lake management software management platform. It is open source
and provides features like data ingestion with data clensing and validation, 
metadata management, governance and security. 

It can connect to many data sources and infer the schema from the common
available data formats. Kylo's data inegestion workflow transfers
data from source to Hive tables with various configuration options
which are built around validation of data fields, protection of data,
data profiling, data security and overall governance.

Kylo includes a metadata repository and provides key capabilities for data 
exploration. Using this feature, users can search in data and metadata
to explore their entities of interest to gain insights. 


By utilizing Kylo's capabilities, designers can develop new
pipeline templates in Apache Nifi. Kylo and Nifi can communicate between 
each other to handle tasks between the cluster and the data center.
The combination of Kylo and Nifi enables data owners to create new
data feeds\cite{hid-sp18-408-TeradataKylo}.
