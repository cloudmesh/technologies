\section{Amazon Aurora}

Amazon's Aurora is a relational database that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL that puts together performance and availability of databases with the power, ``simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases''~\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazon-aurora}. Compared to standard MySQL databases, Aurora provides speeds that are up to five times that higher. It's performance is increased by utilizing an SSD-based storage that helps reduce delays and workloads to the system. It is also designed to reduce Input/Output operations and costs so that resources can be available.
