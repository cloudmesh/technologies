\section{Intel Cloud Finder}



Intel Cloud finder is an enterprise level solution for choosing cloud
service provider. It helps the customers seeking help for cloud
service providers. It also provides a very good resource for people
looking for a very good performance with decent amount of security in
the cloud. They state that ``In the domain of Intel Cloud Technology
we have Intel Advanced vector expansions, Intel Turbo boost technology
and Intel Xeon processor but on the security side we have Intel
trusted execution technology hardware-based protection for the cloud,
ensuring a secure foundation and protecting applications against
malware, malicious software, and other attacks''~\cite{hid-sp18-410-Intel}

looking forward to using this tool for selecting cloud
services that would satisfy personal cloud requirements. Obviosly we need to
wait until Intel makes this tool open to public as this looks to be
proprietary tool.
