Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, 
and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, 
or the cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-513-docker}. It is designed to make it easier to
create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a 
developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, 
such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 
Docker is like a virtual machine but it does not require to create a whole 
virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux 
kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications 
be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives 
a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application 
~\cite{hid-sp18-513-opensource}.
