Cloud AutoML is an innovative tool with simple graphical user interface to train
and test users custom machine learning models~\cite{hid-sp18-602-www-cloudautoml-main}.
And these models can be directly used from Google cloud via REST API. 

The main purpose of developing Cloud AutoML is to enable users with limited 
machine learning expertise to train high quality ML models. It is built on Google
learning to learn, transfer learning, and Neural Architecture Search 
technologies.

Google has recently launched first product under Cloud AutoML: AutoML Vision 
which is a service to access a pre-trained model or create a custom ML models using
Cloud ML Engine, for image recognition. It offers drag-and-drop interface to 
upload images, train and manage models, and then deploy those trained models 
directly on Google Cloud. For instance, Disney and Zoological Society of London are
actively using AutoML Vision~\cite{hid-sp18-602-wwww-cloudautoml-blog}.
