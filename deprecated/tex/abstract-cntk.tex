The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is an open-source project that
can be used for implementing distributed deep learning commercially.
Per Microsoft, ``CNTK allows the user to easily realize and combine
popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs/LSTMs)''. Under the
covers, CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent that are
automatically parallelized across multiple GPUs and
servers~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-cntk}. As of this date, CNTK can be run
on both Windows and Linux operating systems. ``CNTK also supports the
description of neural networks via C++, Network Definition
Language (NDL) and other descriptive languages such as Python and
C\#''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-kd-cntk}.
