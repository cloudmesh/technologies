Lumify is an open source project developed at US national security
contractor Altamira, with key features indlucing big data fusion, 
analysis, and visualization platform. The web-based interface provides users 
with the ability to discover connections and explore relationships in their
data via various analytic options. These options include 2D and 3D
graph visualizations, full-text faceted search, dynamic histograms,
interactive geographic maps, and collaborative workspaces shared in
real-time~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-lumify}. Lumify has an Open
Layers-compatible mapping system which can be utilized by tools like
Google Maps to display an interactive geospatial analysis of the data
set. Further, Lumify was integrated with SAP's high speed HANA
in-memory database and computation engine, which enables faster data
retrieval and calculation speed compared to the use of conventional
database system~\cite{hid-sp18-405-linkedinblog-lumify}. By August
2017, Altamira's Lumify is available through both the Microsoft Azure
Marketplace and Amazon AWS Marketplace. The tool can be immediately
run on the Azure and AWS cloud platforms, where customers have the
option to purchase a license from 
Altamira~\cite{hid-sp18-405-wwwaws-lumify}\cite{hid-sp18-405-wwwazure-lumify}.
 These cloud technologies allow for greater flexibility and usability of Lumify.
