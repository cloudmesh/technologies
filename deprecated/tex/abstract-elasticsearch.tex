The central engine to the Elastic product line, Elasticsearch is a
distributed, RESTful search engine designed to grow with growing
data. Elastic search is a search engine based on Apache's Lucene
search library with the first version being released in early
2010~\cite{hid-sp18-507-ElasticWiki}. Elasticsearch is capable of
searching and storing multiple data types, including numeric data,
text, geo, and varying levels of structured data using s schema-free
JSON format. In adition to the ability to search in real-time,
Elasticsearch is capable of analyzing queried results. Elasticsearch's
use is compatible with multiple languages such as Curl, Java, Python,
C-Sharp, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, and
more~\cite{hid-sp18-507-Elasticsearch}. DB-Engines, a ``Knowledge Base
of Relational and NoSQL Database Management Systems'' ranks
Elasticsearch as the top search engine, ahead of both Splunk and
Solr~\cite{hid-sp18-507-DBEngines}.
