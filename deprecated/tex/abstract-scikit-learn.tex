A Google Summer of Code project, scikit-learn project is a
machine-learning library.  Written in Python, it is designed to be
simple and efficient, accessible to non-experts, and reusable in
various contexts. Its goal is to provide a set of common algorithms to
Python users through a consistent interface.

This package focuses on bringing m achine learning to non-specialists
using a general-purpose high-level language that is easy tofollow.
``Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API
consistency.  It has minimal dependencies and is distributed under the
simplified BSD license, encouraging its use in both academic and
commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and documentation can be
downloaded from http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net''

Although the library is easy to use its sophisticationand power to
analyze big data is never lost. This library has earned respect not
only in the academe but also in the industry. There are increasing
demand in the job market for scientist and engineers who specialize in
this library. The author himself has personally used this library and
can attest to its functionality. It has simplified a lot of usage of
algorithms but it still is a powerful tool.
