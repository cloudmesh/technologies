IBM Db2 Big Sql fecilitates operations like accessing data, querying data and
analsying data across data warehouses and also Hadoop.

It is a well formed hybrid engine that lets you get data by querying 
Hadoop using SQL. It gives you the flexibilty of having a single database
connection or make queries to different data sources such as ``HDFS, RDBMS,
NoSql databases, object stores and WebHDFS.''~\cite{IBM DB2 Bi Sql}
One of the most important feature of this Big Sql is that it provides
low latency. This makes data retrival easier in complex business systems.
It also provides high performance, security, SQL compatibility and federation
capabilities to your data warehouses. 

It enables short, rapid queries that facilitates searching by key word or key 
ranges. It uses HBase for operations such as point queries and rapid insert.
Workloads can be updated and deleted via this Hbase. To make use of easier and
faster data processing in Apache Spark, it can be integrated with Spark\cite{hid-sp18-408-IBMDB2BigSql}.
