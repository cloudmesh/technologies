Stardog is a graph database from US-software company
Complexible. Stardog has a particular focus on OWL and RDF-based
systems, with the latest release Stardog 5.2 (9 January 2018) supports
SPARQL query language; property graph model and Gremlin graph
traversal language; OWL 2 and user-defined rules for inference and
data analytics; virtual graphs; geospatial query answering; and
programmatic interaction via several languages and network
interfaces~\cite{hid-sp18-405-wwwdocs-stardog}. Further, the
developers of StarDog OWL/RDF DBMS have pioneered a new use of OWL as
a schema language for RDF databases. This is achieved by adding
integrity constraints (IC), also expressed in OWL syntax, to the
traditional \textit{open-world} OWL
axioms~\cite{hid-sp18-405-cer2012graphical-stardog}. Other key
features of Stardog include Machine Learning and Logical Inference,
Semantic Search, Geospatial Search etc.\ As a commercial software,
Stardog is priced for community, developer and enterprise tiers. The
enterprise version has a free 30-day trial and the community version
is free to download and use for up to four users and ten graph
databases~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-stardog}.
