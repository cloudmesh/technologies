``OrientDB is the open source NoSQL multi-model database that works with graph 
databases''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OrientDB}. Along with this it can be set up as 
document database and Object-Oriented database. 
``Graph databases are NoSQL databases which use the graph data model comprised 
of vertices, which is an entity such as a person, place, object or relevant 
piece of data and edges, which represent the relationship between two nodes.
Graph databases are particularly helpful because they highlight the links and
relationships between relevant data similarly to how we do so ourselves.
Even though graph databases are awesome, they are not enough on their own.
Advanced second-generation NoSQL products like OrientDB are the future. The 
modern multi-model database provides more functionality and flexibility while
being powerful enough to replace traditional 
DBMSs''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OrientDB-graph}.
Graph databases are usefull for developing application related to social 
networking and establish relationships between objects with respect to there 
properties. It maintains class relation using documents and links in document 
model.
