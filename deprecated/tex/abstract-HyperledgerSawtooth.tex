\index{Hyperledger}

Hyperledger Sawtooth is an open source, blockchain platform which can
be used to build distributed ledger applications. It's main
application is to simplify the development of blockchain applications
by isolating the core system from the application domain. ``This
allows for developers to quickly and easily develop and deploy
applications with custom tailored business rules in some of the more
common languages''~\cite{hid-sp18-414-Hyperledger_Sawtooth}.

Some of the core features that make Hyperledger Sawtooth a unique and
interesting distributed ledger technology:
  
``On-chain governance - Utilize smart contracts to vote on blockchain
configuration settings such as the allowed participants and smart
contracts.  Advanced transaction execution engine - Process
transactions in parallel to accelerate block creation and validation.
Support for Ethereum - Run solidity smart contracts and integrate with
Ethereum tooling.  Dynamic consensus - Upgrade or swap the blockchain
consensus protocol on the fly as your network grows, enabling the
integration of more scalable algorithms as they are available.  Broad
language support - Program smart contracts in your preferred language,
with support including Go, JavaScript, Python and 
more.''~\cite{hid-sp18-414-Linux_Foundation_Sawtooth}
