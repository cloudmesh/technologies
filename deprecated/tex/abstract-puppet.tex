\section{Puppet}

Puppet~\cite{hid-sp18-413-puppet} is a open source software configuration and
automation tool. It is written in C++ and Clojure. Puppet is a declarative
language and uses domain specific language for configuration. Puppet uses facter
to gather information about the system and user defines the desired
state. Puppet does not use sequential programming where order of execution is
key but uses graphical representation to represent the order of
execution. Resources are defined in manifests written in Domain specific
language. These manifests are complied into catalogue on puppet master and
supplied to puppet clients. These catalogues are only applied if actual and
desired states are different. ``Kubernetes~\cite{hid-sp18-413-Kubernetes} is
new cluster manager from google'' and puppet makes it easy to manage the
kubernetes resources. Puppet is declarative, modular, has code testing features
and therefore managing kubernetes with it is easier.
