Neptune is a graph database service that was announced at the AWS
Re:INVENT conference in November of
2017~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-tc_neptune}. Graph databases are NoSQL
databases that used graph structures to organize
data~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-tp-graph-db}. They are commonly used for
social networking applications, but can be used for recommendation
engines, logistics, and other applications. Amazon offers Neptune as a
fully managed product. It supports Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL
open source graph APIs. One can choose Gremlin or the W3C standard
Resource Description Framework
model~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-aws-neptune}.
