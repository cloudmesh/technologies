\section{Clojure}

Clojure~\cite{hid-sp18-413-clojure} is a fully functional scripting
language. Although it is a complied programming language, all its features are
available at runtime. Clojure is based on Lisp~\cite{hid-sp18-413-lisp} and
uses the same eco system. It provides access to Java framework including hints
and type inference. Clojure's main advantage is its implementation of
multithreaded programming.Clojure very efficiently breaks a task into subtasks
and places them on different JVM threads for parallel processing. Parallel
programming has three challenges called three goblins; reference cells, mutual
exclusion and dwarves berserkers and Clojure handles them by implementing three
tools called futures, delays and promises.
