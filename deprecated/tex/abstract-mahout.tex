Apache Mahout, an Apache Software Foundation project, is a distributed
Scala DSL based linear algebra framework designed to aid
mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists in implementing
their own algorithms quickly and
efficiently~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-Mahout}. Initiated based on Andrew
Ng et al.'s paper ``Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on
Multicore''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-ng-Mahout}, it has evolved over time to
cover other general machine-learning
approaches~\cite{hid-sp18-510-ibm-Mahout}. While Apache Spark is
recommended back end, where core algorithms are implemented on top of
Apache Hadoop, Mahout is also extensible to other back ends and
standalone implementations~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout}. While
number of algorithms supported by Apache Mahout is increasing, its
core algorithms primarily contain implementations for clustering,
classification, and Collaborative
filtering~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout}.
