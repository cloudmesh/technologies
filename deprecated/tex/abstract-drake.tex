Drake is an R package focused on reproducible research and
high-performance computing~\cite{hid-sp18-403-R-drake}. It is an
R-centric version of Make. The core functionality of Drake is based on
the idea that space is cheaper than time.  Therefore, it stores local
caches of target objects when they are built, along witht the commands
that were used to build them. From this, it can build a dependency
network, and automatically determine which objects are outdated before
the next run, and only build the required objects. Because it is
R-focused, it has an advantage over \textit{make} in that it allows
for easy plan expansion, rather than make's requirement for explicit
commands and targets.  Drake also enables higher performance
computing, by allowing users to build multiple targets at once,
elevating R past its single threaded default.
