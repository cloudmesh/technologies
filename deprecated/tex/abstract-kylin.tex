\section{Kylin}

Apache Kylin is an Online analytical processing or OLAP engine developed 
specially for Big Data applications. Analysts around the world today 
use SQL interfaces to query data from traditional database systems, 
Kylin fits in well due to this as it provides SQL interface as well 
as OLAP capability for Hadoop ecosystem which no other tool provides 
today. Kylin is very efficient and can return billions of rows in 
minimum time. It integrates well other BI tools such as Tableau. 
Kylin is rich in features and provides, incremental refresh of cubes, 
web interface for monitoring and management and ldap integration as 
well. Since Kylin was specially built for Hadoop and big data 
applications, it depends on some of the components such as HBase, 
Hive and HDFS. HBase is used to store the data cube, map reduce does 
the cube refresh or partial refresh job and HDFS stores intermediate 
files during cube building process~\cite{hid-sp18-517-ApacheKylin}.
