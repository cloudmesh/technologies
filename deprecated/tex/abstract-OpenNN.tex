``OpenNN is an open source class library written in C++ programming language
which implements neural networks, a main area of machine learning research.
The main advantage of OpenNN is its high performance. It is developed in 
C++ for better memory management and higher processing speed, and 
implements CPU parallelization. The library implements any number of layers
of non-linear processing units for supervised learning. This deep 
architecture allows the design of neuralnetworks with universal approximation
properties''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OpenNN}.
``Neural Designer has been developed from OpenNN, which is a advanced analytical
tool and contains a graphical user interface which simplifies data entry
and interpretation of results''~cite{hid-sp18-520-OpenNN}.
``The class of neural network implemented in OpenNN is based on the multilayer 
perceptron. That model is extended here to contain scaling, unscaling, bounding,
probabilistic and conditions layers''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OpenNNn}.
``OpenNN includes project files for Qt Creator. When working with another 
compiler is needed,a project for it must be created''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OpenNNb}.
