The number of connected devices are constantly increasing.
Many of the devices that form the internet of thingss (IoT) are sensors,
or devices that are lightweight and do not have a lot of storage space
or processing power.
Apache Edgent is a programming model that allows development in Java and
Android environments and provides a way to perform analytics locally on
the edge devices, thus preventing the need to send data back and forth to
servers~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-edgent}. Apache Edgent can help reduce
the amount of data needed to be stored as analytics can be performed on
the data continuously and, only relevent information such as outliers
that need to be recorded or data that needs further analysis that require
higher computation resources need to be sent to the server
\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-edgent-docs}.

Apache edgent can work along with centralized analytics tools thus providing
a way to do more thorough analysis on the IoT system. Edgent can
communicate with with backend systems using common messaging hubs and
communication protocols like MQTT, Apache Kafka, IBM Watson IoT platform,
and allows custom message hubs as well~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-edgent-docs}.
