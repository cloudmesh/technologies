As an increasing number of connected devices communicate data with
each other, data security must be taken into account. Apache Milagro
is a security framework, built for cloud based software and Internet
of Things (IoT) applications, that reauire to be
scalable~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-milagro}. Apache milagro is a
pairing-based cryptography system that distriburtes cryptographic
operations among various entities to provide a deeper level of
security as compared to monolithic certificate based systems used
today~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-milagro-docs}.

Apache milagro avoids the probelms faced by certificate based systems
like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) such as single point of failure,
by the use of distributed trust authorities (D-TAs), which hold a part
of a client's key each and are isolated from each other. The absence
of a central certificate provider means that anyone can be a D-TA the
key lifecycle is a part of ythe crypto system
itself~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-milagro-docs}.
