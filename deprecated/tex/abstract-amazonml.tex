\section{Amazon Machine Learning}

AmazonML is a service for machine learning that makes it possible to design and build applications that can be used for prediction, forecasting et cetera. It employs algorithms that can help create models that can be used to train and discern patterns from data. A trained model can be used to determine trends that can be used to make predictions when given new sets of data. The Amazon's Machine Learning API ``provides data and model visualization tools, as well as wizards to guide you through the process of creating machine learning models,''~\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazonml-b}. It is a service that is highly scalable and can be used to create large numbers of predictions in real-time. The framework also supports Amazon Machine Images (AMI) that provide the resources for faster development of sophisticated models. ``The AMI's are pre-installed with Apache MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Caffe, Theano, Torch, Gluon, and Keras to train sophisticated, custom AI models.''~\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazonml-a}
