\section{Weka}

Weka~\cite{hid-sp18-413-weka} is a machine learning environment that provides
grapical interface. It has a library of machine learning algorithms for data
mining tasks.It was developed in Waikato university New Zealand. Python and R
have advanced tools for machine learning but can be difficult to learn specially
for a beginner and Weka makes this transition easier. Weka is written in Java
and has its own API\@. All tasks performed with GUI can be also performed in
CLI@\@. It's GUI has Explorer to learn, experimenter to run experiments and
Knowledge flow to build pipelines for actual implementations.
