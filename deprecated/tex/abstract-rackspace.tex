\section{Rackspace}

Rackspace is a cloud computing company which administrates cloud system for their
business partners and further helping them to concentrate on managing the
business growth of their partners. Rackspace differentiates itself from other
companies by stating that the cloud system alone which is provided by other
companies are not sufficient to operate the infrastructure efficiently.

Rackspace proudly states that it takes several innovative and cognitive
engineering skills to develop and manage the infrastructure and also
concentrating on tools and applications which are necessary to administrate. BY
providing all such toolwith updated data engines and e-commerce platforms,
Rackspace claims that it will manage cloud and infrastructure of their business
partners in a much different and efficient way~\cite{hid-sp18-406-Rackspace}.
