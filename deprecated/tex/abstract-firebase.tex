\section{Firebase}

Firebase is an open source project found by James Tamplin and Andrew
Lee in 2011 and later acquired by Google in
2014~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firebase}. Firebase cloud services started
as an online chat message service and soon expanded to provide cloud
services such as Firebase cloud messaging, Firebase auth, realtime
database, Firebase storage, Firebase hosting, Firebase test lab for
Android and iOS and Firebase crash
reporting~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firebase-official}. A new version of
Firebase has released after merging with Google and it provides an
unified cloud platform to build Android, iOS, and web Apps
\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firebase-official}. After the acquisition,
Google has stopped supporting their cloud messaging services and
merged it with firebase cloud messaging
services~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firebase-merged}. Admob, Analytics,
Authentication, Indexing, Test Lab, and Push Notifications are few
important features introduced in the latest release of Firebase
\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firebase-official}. As James
\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firebase} stated, push notification support for
Android and iOS mobile application is recently identified as the most
famous feature of firebase cloud services.
