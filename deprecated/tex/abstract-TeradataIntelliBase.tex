\section{Teradata Intellibase}

Teradata Intellibase provides a compact environment to perform
data warehousing, data exploration in an iterative way and advanced 
analytics using the stored data. Storage of data come at a low cost 
in Intellibase.

The platform enables a combination of Teradata and Hadoop nodes
to make up for the varied workload requirements. It does this by installing
everything into a single cabinet to preserve the floor space in the data
center.

The features include Teradata Database, Hadoop, Terdata Aster Analytics and
Teradata Unified Data Architecture. With these features, it enables application
deployment in a single cabinet. It also provides advanced in-memory computing 
and also provides data protection for all the data sources. The hardware could 
be re-deployed elsewhere thereby reducing infrastructure costs. Additionally,
it also provides software re-imaging for quick replication.

The technology specifications include 18 nodes, 375 TB of uncompresed data from
user and 18TB of memory in a single cabinet. The processors are dual multi-core 
Intel Xeon Processors\cite{hid-sp18-408-TeradataIntellibase}.
