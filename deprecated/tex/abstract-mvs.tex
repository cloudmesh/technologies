Microsoft Visual Studio (MVS), community edition, is an open source ``integrated
development interface IDE applicable for the development of computer programs, 
websites, web services, web and mobile apps''~\cite{hid-sp18-415-wikipedia-org}. While 
the interface consists of some built-in tools such as code editor, code profiler
and integrated debugger, it also supports plugins dependending on  requirements 
of visual designer. Javascript, C++, XML, CSS, \verb|.NET| are among some of the 
built -in languages for visual studio. But it supports quite a big number, 
that is 36 different, types of languages. Python, Ruby, Node.js and M are 
some of the languages available by plugins.  Multiple instances with their own
set of packages and specific App-id, can be run at the same time. MVS 
connects to windows AZURE making it portable for
developers~\cite{hid-sp18-415-wikipedia-org}.
