\section{Firepad}

Firepad is an open source real-time collaborative code and text
editing cloud platform found by Google in 2016 and licensed under
MIT~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firepad}.  It is mostly used for rich text
editing and code editing as it is empowered with true collaborative
editing and intelligent operational transform-based merging and
conflict resolution~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firepad-wikipedia}. Some
important features included in the Firepad are cursor position
synchronization, undo and redo, text highlighting, user attribution,
presence detection and version check-pointing. As Michael
Lehenbauer~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firepad}, the founder of Firepad
claims that it has no server dependencies and yet provide real-time
data synchronization using the Firebase realtime database technology.
It is easy to integrate Firepad to any application since inclusion of
few JavaScript files would enable the Firepad in all modern browsers
such as Chrome, Safari, Opera 11+, IE8+ and Firefox 3.6+
\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-firepad}. As Firepad website showcases,
Socrates.io, Nitrous.IO, LiveMinutes, Koding, CoderPad.io and
ShiftEdit are few successful applications which utilizes
Firepad~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-databricks}
