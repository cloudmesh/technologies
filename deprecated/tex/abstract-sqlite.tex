\index{SQLite}

SQLite is an open source, embedded relational database. Originally 
released in 2000, it has outstanding performance in terms of 
portability, ease of use, compactness, availability, and 
reliability~\cite{www-sqlite}.

SQLite has an exquisite, modular architecture and has introduced 
some unique methods for relational database management. It consists
of eight independent modules organized in three subsystems~\cite{www-sqlite-archi}.
This model divides the query process into several discrete tasks, 
just like working on the assembly line. The query is compiled at 
the top of the architectural stack, executed in the middle, and the
operating system's storage and interfaces are processed at the bottom.
