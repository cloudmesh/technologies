IBM has compiled data science tools in one location, 
called Data Science Experience. This one location provides
access to the IBM Cloud, and allows a customer to run 
applications from the public or private cloud 
\cite{hid-sp18-525-dsx}.
Data Science Experience also allows desktop operations 
of popular tools\cite{hid-sp18-525-dsx}.
IBM's Watson computing platform is available in Data Science
Experience. Machine learning models through Watson utilizing
its vast computing resources. Additionally, open source 
applications and technologies, such as Python, R, and Apache 
Spark give users a robust data science toolkit from which to
work\cite{hid-sp18-525-dsx}.
Every aspect of data science is available in Data Science 
Experience. Visual- izations of results are a part of Data 
Science Experience. Tools such as PixieDust and Brunel are 
available, without programming
experience\cite{hid-sp18-525-dsx}.
