Ripple Transaction Protocol is an open-source protocol that allows
transfer of anything of value (usually payments) on the internet.

``The Ripple network enables secure, instant and nearly free global
financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks''
\cite{hid-sp18-506-RippleNetwork}.  ``Ripple provides one frictionless
experience to send money globally using the power of
blockchain''~\cite{hid-sp18-506-GlobalPayment}.


There are 3 problems that ripple are trying to solve in the current
payment systems available now high fees, charges for currency
exchanges and processing delays.

Banks today built their own system for their customers that dont
easily interact with each other.  The Ripple network is designed to
connect different payment systems together.

With ripple the transaction fees are very minimal and comparative less
than what for example Visa charges. And there are no foreign
exnchanges loses since the the currency is never converted to any
other currency from the source to the destination. The transfer is
also completed within minutes compared to the usual 3-business-days
waiting period when sending money thru the traditional means.
