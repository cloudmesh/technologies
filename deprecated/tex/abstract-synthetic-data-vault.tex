\index{Synthetic Data Vault}

The most notable synthetic data generator is the Synthetic Data Vault
(SDV)\cite{hid-sp18-526-patki-sdv}. Developed at MIT by Neha Patki, 
Roy Wedge, and Kalyan Veeramachaneni, the Synthetic Data Vault uses 
machine learning techniques to model database structure and content. 
The models can then be used to generate entirely synthetic tables 
and relationships which are true to the form of the originals. 
Because the synthetic data is generated and modeled mathematically
according to the original data, very little, if any, insight is lost. Here
we will explore why we should use synthetic data, how SDV generates synthetic
data, and how to use the data generated by SDV.

SDV is written in Python and is, therefore, cross-platform. A separate file
is required for each database in the table. Also, each database requires a
configuration file in json format. The specifications for the configuration
file will be shown later, but first we will discuss why such a product is
necessary.
