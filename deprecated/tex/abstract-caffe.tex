Caffe is a deep learning framework developed by Berkeley AI Research. 
Caffe is optimized for research experiments and industrial applications. 
Caffe is built in C++ and CUDA with interfaces available in Python and 
MATLAB~\cite{hid-sp18-404-Evan}. The open source collection 
of deep learning models is a valuable bundle of tools for research with 
models including picture pattern recognition, text parsing, and speech 
composition~\cite{hid-sp18-404-jia2014caffe}.
