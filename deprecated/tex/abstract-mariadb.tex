MariaDB is an open source relational database. It has 12 million users worldwide 
and one of the fastest growing databases in the 
world~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb}. It powers applications at leading 
companies like booking.com, Virgin Mobile, HP 
etc.~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb}. It was created by the original developers
of MySQL~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-mysql} and Michael \textit{Monty} Widenius 
is the lead developer of MariaDB, also the founder of MySQL 
AB~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-mariadb}. It was developed to be an enhanced, 
drop-in replacement for MySQL~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb-foundation}. It is 
available in Debian~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-debian-org} and 
Ubuntu~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-ubuntu}, and is now the default database on 
many Linux~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-linux} distributions. It supports a broad 
set of use cases by using different storage engines for different use cases. These 
pluggable storage engines make MariaDB a flexible, robust and scalable database 
solution~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb-server}. Up until 10.1 version of MariaDB, 
it used Percona's XtraDB as the default storage engine, but from version 10.2, 
MariaDB uses InnoDB as the default storage 
engine~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-xtradb}. Additional featured storage engines
in 10.2 version include \textit{MyRocks} for better performance and efficiency,
and \textit{Spider} for scaling out with distributed storage, however these are
under technical preview~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb-server}. MariaDB intends
to maintain compatibility with MySQL~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-mariadb}, but
it also aims at providing a rich ecosystem of storage engines, plugins and many
other tools to make it versatile for a wide variety of use
cases~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb-foundation}. It is used to turn data into
structured information for a wide variety of applications, ranging from banking
to websites. MariaDB also supports GIS and JSON features in its latest
versions~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb-foundation}. It is highly secure,
reliable and trusted by the world's leading brands. It is used to support
enterprise needs from OLTP to analytics~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-mariadb}.
