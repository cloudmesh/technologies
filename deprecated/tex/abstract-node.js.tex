Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that provides a scalable 
option for net-work applications. Node.js requires less 
system resources to perform thanis common
\cite{hid-sp18-525-nodejs}. Using less system resources does 
allowNode.js to scale. This is ideal for large web 
applications, such as libraries\cite{hid-sp18-525-nodejs}. 
Generally, Node.js creates server-side applications 
\cite{hid-sp18-525-nodejs}. JavaScript language is used by 
Node.js, and the two often compliment each
other, on opposite sides of a transaction 
\cite{hid-sp18-525-nodejs}.
