\index{TensorFlow}

``TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the 
graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated 
between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one 
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. 
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the 
Google Brain Team within Google Machine Intelligence research organization for 
the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, 
but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other 
domains as well''~\cite{hid-sp18-520-TensorFlow}.
TensorFlow provides a platform for implementing and execute machine learning
algorithms and is highly popular with deep neural network models and algorithms.
TensorFlow is cross-platform, it can support mobile and embedded platforms. It has
lot of API to support complex computations and algorithms.
