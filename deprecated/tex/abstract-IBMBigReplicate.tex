\section{IBM Big Replicate}

To make Hadoop deployment enterprise-class, easy data replication is required 
to support critical business applications that depend on Hadoop. Keeping this 
in mind, IBM created IBM Big Replicate which does class replication for Hadoop
and object store.

The main features of the product include
continuous availability, high performance with guaranteed data 
consistency. Also, it replicates large amounts of data from lab to production 
environment, from production to disaster recovery sites. These replications are
governed by the business rules set up. This technology replicates data as the 
data streams in. Thus, it reduces dependency on completion of file operation 
i.e., closing of file before data can be transferred. It offers replication in
a flexible way by handling various Hadoop ditributions and verisons. 
Additionally, for each cluster, multiple IBM Big Replicate can be deployed as 
proxy servers to add resilience. Users can access Hadoop Distributed File 
System using Big Replicate via the standard HDFS URI\cite{hid-sp18-408-IBMBigReplicate}.
