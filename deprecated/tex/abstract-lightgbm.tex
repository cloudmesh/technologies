\section{LightGBM} 

"A fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting(GBDT, GBRT, GBM or
MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking,
classification and many other machine learning tasks. It is under the umbrella
of the DMTK project of Microsoft"~\cite{hid- sp18-401-lightgbm}.

LightGBM is used to implement gradient boosting algorithm in machine learning
with the aim to do so fastly, at the same time not compromising on high
performance.  A couple of lines on gradient boosting is necessary in
understanding the context and relevance of LightGBM. Gradient Boosting is a
machine learning technique used to build both regression and classification
models. It is primarily used in building decision trees. But building gradient
boosting models on huge datasets(that sometimes contain more than 500,000
observations) is computationally onerous, not so efficient.  LightGBM solves
this problem and that is why it is gaining popularity in Machine Learning
community and people are using this in their Kaggle machine learning projects.
