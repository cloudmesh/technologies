``Google Cloud Vision API has made the herculean task of correct 
labeling/classification of images simple. With exponential increase 
in different types of data including images, voice, video are 
transformed into digital form, stored and transmitted over network. 
There was a dire need of automated technology solution that can 
correctly classify / label images with high level of confidence; 
Google Vision API provides such platform to researchers and developers. 
It quickly classify images into thousands of predefined 
meaning ful categories''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision}. 
It does this by encapsulating powerful machine learning 
models (KNN, Regression) etc for classification of images. 
``It help detects objects and faces within images, finds and reads 
printed words contained within images through 
OCR''~\cite{hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision}. 
``Developers can build meta data on their image catalog, moderate 
offensive content, or launch new marketing campaign/scenarios through 
image sentiment analysis. It can be accessed
