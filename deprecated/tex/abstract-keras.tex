\section{Keras} 

"Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of
running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano"~\cite{hid-sp18-401-keras}.

Keras is used in deep learning community to build neural nets with easy to use
syntax. There are other technologies/software packages like TensorFlow, Pytorch
which are also used to build neural networks, but the syntax and documentation
is long and difficult for a beginner in deep learning community. Keras kind of
acts as a wrapper around TensorFlow with easy to use syntax but not compromising
on different tools/options within building neural network.

Using Keras, we can build normal Dense ANNs, Convolutional Neural Nets, Optimize
our neural network by specifying loss function and optimization method, do
regularization of neural network with techniques such as dropout, etc..
