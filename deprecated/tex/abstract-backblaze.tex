Backblaze is a cloud backup service~\cite{hid-sp18-601-www-bblaze-about}, 
providing solutions to business~\cite{hid-sp18-601-www-bblaze-business} and 
private users~\cite{hid-sp18-601-www-bblaze-personal}. Backblaze plans do not
have a limit for the amount of data you can backup and the software continuously 
uploads data present on your device. 

If the backup is ever needed it can be downloaded. For cases were the amount of 
data is to much to be downloaded Backblaze offers a service to mail a encripted 
flash drive or hard drive instead.
