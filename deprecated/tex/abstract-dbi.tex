DBI is a package for R that provides a common interface to databases
for R programmers to use~\cite{hid-sp18-403-R-dbi}. This allows
R to access data that is too big to fit into local memory, or even
onto local disk. Key components are classes for database connections,
and database results, which can be treated differently, to minimize
local computation. Connections to particular database systems, such as
MySQL, or PostgreSQL are handled through connectivity packages, such
as \texttt{odbc}~\cite{hid-sp18-403-rstudio-odbc}.
