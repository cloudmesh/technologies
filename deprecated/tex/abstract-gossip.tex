Many of the applications that are cloud based and require a huge amount of
computation or data storage in the back end, use cloud based clusters. When
different nodes in a cluster rely on services provided by other nodes, it
becomes important that each node has information about the others, to avoid
failures. Apache Gossip is a protocol that provides a method that allows
nodes to form a peer-to-peer network and allows them to discover other
nodes and check the liveliness of the cluster
\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-gossip}.

The name arises from the family of protocols known as gossip protocols or
epidemic protocols that disemminate information in a manner similar to how
gossip spreads in a community. Each node periodically selects any other
node at random and shares the information it has, thus eliminating the need
to broadcast from every node to every other node in the cluster
\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-gossip-wiki}.
