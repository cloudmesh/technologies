\section{MongoDB}

MongoDB is document database that belongs to the NoSQL family of 
databases. MongoDB is free and open-source, published under the 
GNU Affero General Public License. It is known for its scalability 
and flexibility. MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like 
documents. MongoDB's HA features include automatic failover and 
data redundancy, this is achieved using replica set, which is 
nothing but group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data. 
MongoDB supports sharding by distributing the data across the 
cluster of machines~\cite{hid-sp18-517-MongoDB-intro}.
