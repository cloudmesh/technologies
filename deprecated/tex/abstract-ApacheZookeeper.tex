\section{Apache Zookeeper}

Zookeeper is a open source centralized service that enables synchronization
across cluster. It is also designed to maintain naming, configuration
information, and provide  group services.

An application can create znode in Zookeeper which can be updated by any node in
the cluster and updates on that node can have track of changes to that znode.
This kind of znodes are used to keep track of updates in the entire cluster
which is how it provides centralized 
infrastructure~\cite{hid-sp18-421-zookeeper}.
