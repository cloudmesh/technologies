\section{Amazon CloudFront}

A Content Delivery Network is a \emph{globally distributed network of
  webservers} \cite{hid-sp18-512-amazon-cloudfront-b} over the
internet at different geographical locations. They form a huge part of
internet services today and are deployed at different locations to
ensure faster content load times, and lower bandwidths over a
network. This technology is highly ``useful to companies that require
higher response times''~\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazon-cloudfront-b} and
distribution of large files to many users at a given time. It helps
accelerate delivery by moving the content close to the end-user
therefore reducing hops through the internet. This is often done
through caching the content inside a server that is closer to the
user. With this, network performance is accelerated, including global
presence, and smart computing. Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery
Network (CDN) that is integrated in Amazons AWS service. It is one of
the largest in the world, including others such as Akamai, MaxCDN, and
Rackspace. CloudFront is continuing to grow globally and currently
``includes 44 availability zones in 16 different geographic regions
today''\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazon-cloudfront-a}. This also includes
plans for constructing 14 other zones in the coming future.
