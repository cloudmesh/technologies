\section{Paxata}

One of the most important and time consuming job of data scientist is to clean
and prepare data from multiple sources in a format that it can be
analyzed. Paxata~\cite{hid-sp18-413-paxata} semi automates the process by using
its own algorithms. It uses machine learning and text mining combined with its
libraries to efficiently clean data. Paxata provides a spreadsheet like
interface where inconsistencies are color coded and instructions are provided to
clean up data. Paxata visualizes the data in form of graphs and creates
associations between various data objects and uses them to resolve data quality
issues. This data can then be consumed by visualizing softwares like
tableau. With this approach Paxata gives anyone ability to run data analytics on
big data sets in a short amount of time.
