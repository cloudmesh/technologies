\section{Apache SystemML}

Apache SystemML is an~\cite{systemml} open-source language and
compiler that makes it dramatically easier to build custom machine
learning solutions.Apache SystemML is \cite{systemml} flexible,
scalable and optimal for Big Data that enables automatic
optimization.SystemML's enables~\cite{systemml} algorithm
customizability via R-like and Python-like languages.It also
has~\cite{systemml_blog} multiple execution modes, including Spark
MLContext, Spark Batch, Hadoop Batch, Standalone, and JMLC. It
characteristics includes~\cite{systemml_blog} automatic optimization
based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency
and scalability.
