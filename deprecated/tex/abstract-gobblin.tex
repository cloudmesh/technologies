As the amount of data increases and its sources become numerous, it
gets difficult to integrate this data to solve a specific
problem. Apache Gobblin~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-gobblin} is a distributed
data integration framework that allows users to build different data
integration applications, usually as separate jobs wihch are executed
with the help of a scheduler
\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-gobblin-docs}. Gobblin can be deployed in a
stand alone manner and also supports deployment on a Hadooop, Apache
Mesos or Amazon Elastic Cloud cluster~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-gobblin}.

Currently Gobblin deployments run independently of each other and
there is no central management o orchestration. However, efforts are
being made to develop Gobblin-as-a-Service which whould manage data
integration jobs on any mode of Gobblin 
deployment~\cite{hid-sp18-503-www-gobblin-docs}.
