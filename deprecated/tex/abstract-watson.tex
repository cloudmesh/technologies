\subsection{Old: IBM Watson}

IBM Watson is a super computer built on cognitive technology that
processes information like the way human brain does by understanding
the data in a natural language as well as analyzing structured and
unstructured data~\cite{www-ibmwatson-wiki}.  It was initially
developed as a question and answer tool more specifically to answer
questions on the quiz show *Jeopardy* but now it has been seen as
helping doctors and nurses in the treatment of cancer. It was
developed by IBM's DeepQA research team led by David Ferrucci. With
Watson you can create bots that can engage in conversation with you
\cite{www-ibmwatson}. You can even provide personalized
recommendations to Watson by understanding a user's personality, tone
and emotion. Watson uses the Apache Hadoop framework in order to
process the large volume of data needed to generate an answer by
creating in-memory datasets used at run-time. Watson's DeepQA UIMA
s (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) annotators were
deployed as mappers in the Hadoop Map-Reduce framework. Watson is
written in multiple programming languages like Java, C++, Prolog and
it runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Today Watson is available
as a set of open source APIs and Software As a Service product as
well\cite{www-ibmwatson}.


\subsection{New: IBM Watson}

IBM's Watson computer, named after the company's first CEO, Thomas
Watson, was created to fulfill an engineering challenge: to defeated
Jeapordy! champions\cite{hid-sp18-525-watson}. Although Watson defeated
for champions, that victory was years in the making.  Numerous
adjustments were required to make all 3 contestants equal.  For
example, Watson was required to push a button, like the other
contestants\cite{hid-sp18-525-watson}. Since the early days of Watson,
many advances in computing have happened. The explosion of machine
learning algorithms and artificial intelligence have greatly expanded
the use of Watson. Watson has developed into a mar- keting slogan, and
is even co-branded with companies, such as H\&R
Block\cite{hid-sp18-525-watson}. Advancements in hardware enabled the
revolution in data analysis that is currently happening. Super
computing, like Watson, along with enhanced al- gorithms have fueled
the revolution. Based on such advances, Watson is now a stand-alone
division at IBM\cite{hid-sp18-525-watson}. Being a separate division and
an individual brand gives IBM the ability to deploy Watson to a myriad
of activities. Watson is the hub of IBM's cloud computing business.
Watson also forecasts the weather and conducts research from any
number of organizations\cite{hid-sp18-525-watson}.
