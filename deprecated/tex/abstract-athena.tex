Amazon Athena~\cite{hid-sp18-521-athena-faq} is a service from AWS that
allows the user to analyze their data stored on Amazon S3 using SQL code. 
It was created with the purpose of allowing anyone with SQL skills 
to quickly analyze large datasets. Athena will allow a user to run 
on demand SQL queries without the need to load or gather the data 
outside of S3 and can process structured, semi-structured and 
unstructured data sets. It it serverless so there is no need to 
deal with the setup or managing of infrastructure. This also allows
Athena to scale automatically in order to be able to handle large datasets
and complex queries. Athena utilizes Presto which is an open source SQL query
engine designed to query data wherever it is stored. You can access
Athena in multiple ways including the AWS Management Console, API or
JDBC driver. It also integrates into Amazon Quicksight allowing you
to visualize the data stored in your S3 environment based on your
Athena queries. Athena is great for fast on demand querying, but can
be used for complex joins, window functions and arrays as well.
