Amazon S3 is a simple storage service which mainly focuses on a highly-scalable,
reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at low

provided by Amazon that can be used to store and retrieve data. It can also be
used for static website hosting for different web applications. Important

store virtually any kind of data in any
format~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-S3-FAQ}.

One of the important features of using S3 is that it offers a highly durable,
scalable, and secure destination for backing up and archiving critical
data~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-S3}. As per AWS documentation, ``Amazon S3 is

millions of applications used by market leaders in every
industry''~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-S3}.

Amazon S3 provides versioning capability to provide even further protection for
stored data. It is easy to define lifecycle rules to automatically migrate less
