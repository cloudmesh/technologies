JMP, commonly referred to as ``Jump'', is an enterprise level
statistical analysis tool developed by SAS. The JMP software package
is designed to handle every data-involved stage from the initial
acquisition of data to the final presentation of findings. JMP was
first released in 1989 and has been designed ever since to provide a
visual-centric interface where the user can analyze, manipulate, and
format data. JMP is capable of complex analysis and machine learning
techniques and can provide the user the back-end software code
generated to produce the visualized results in a variety of common
statistical languages or applications such as Python, R, Matlab, SAS,
and others~\cite{hid-sp18-507-JMP9}. A single JMP license is available
for 1,785 USD~\cite{hid-sp18-507-JMPSAS}. JMP Pro is an even more
capable version of JMP with more advanced analytics and predictive
modeling with cross-validation--available for 14,900
USD~\cite{hid-sp18-507-JMPPro}.
