Hyperledger Iroha is an open source, mobile focused blockchain
platform.  The Japanese startup, Soramitsu in partnership with Hitachi
started the initiative to create a mobile friendly blockchain
architecture. As one of the new, up and coming Hyperledger projects it
focuses on being simple and easy to include in projects and was
implemented in C++ which allows it to, ``perform well with any small
data projects and focused use cases.''~\cite{hid-sp18-414-Behlendorf}.

As stated by the Linux Foundation, ``Hyperledger Iroha is designed to
be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructural projects that
require distributed ledger technology. It features a simple
construction, modern, domain-driven C++ design, emphasis on mobile
application development and a new, chain-based Byzantine Fault
Tolerant consensus algorithm, called 
Sumeragi''~\cite{hid-sp18-414-Active_Status_Iroha}.
