\index{Machine Learning}

RapidMiner is a data science software platform that provides an
integrated environment for data preparation, machine
learning\index{Machine Learning} and model deployment into production.
It provide the facility to connect to various sources of different
format and different scale to collect the data, data exploration to
discover the pattern in the data, identity the issues, blending to
find the relevant data for the modeling, clean the data for advanced
algorithms. Once the data is prepared models are built using a nice
workflow designer tool. It provides Classification, regression and
clustering techniques. Validation is performed for cross validation
and split validation after the model development for the accuracy of
the model. On the successful validation of the model it is deployed
into production with governance and security. It is Open and
extensible and provide native R and Python support. The source code is
available under an aGPL license. The platform provides an easy drag
and drop environment for easy and fast data science related
operations~\cite{hid-sp18-511-rapidminer}.
