\section{Amazon VPC}

A VPC is part of the AWS infrastructure that is logically isolated and spans a whole entire region of AWS to which the instances were created. ``It is one of the most used and famous services inside the Amazon Web Services suite''~\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazon-vpc-a}. It provides the possibility of assigning specific IP addresses, subnets, and network rules when establishing communication with other resources within and out of the infrastructure. This way, the traffic between instances of the elastic cloud compute is protected against network intrusion. This service makes it possible to separate public networks from private providing business enterprises the power to decide which instances can be exposed to the outside word and which cannot. VPC's include six major components that are part of the default VPC. These include gateways, Route Tables, Security Groups, Network Access Lists, and the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Blocks. These resources bring out the simplicity, advanced security, and all the scalability and reliability of AWS~\cite{hid-sp18-512-amazon-vpc}
