\section{Azure Cosmos DB}


Azure Cosmos DB is a globally-distributed data service that allows elastically
scaling throughput and storage across any number of geographical regions while
guaranteeing low latency, high availability and consistency~\cite{hid-sp18-501-CosmosDB}. It
can support multiple data models using one backend. This means that it can be
used for document, key value, relational, and graph models. It is more or less a
NoSQL database because it does not rely on any schemas. However, because it uses
query language similar to SQL and can easily support ACID transactions, some
people have been classifying it as a NewSQL type of database. What
differentiates it from other NewSQL databases, however, is that it does not have
a relational data model~\cite{hid-sp18-501-Stackify}
