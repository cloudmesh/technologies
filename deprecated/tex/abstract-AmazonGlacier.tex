\section{Amazon Glacier}

Amazon Glacier is an online file storage web service provided by Amazon which
can be used for data archiving and backup~\cite{hid-sp18-420-Amazon-Glacier}.
Glacier is part of the Amazon Web Services suite designed for long term storage
of data that is accessed infrequently. User can store virtually any kind of data
in any format.

Amazon also provides Simple Storage Service for storing and retrieving data but
Glacier is much cheaper than S3. As per AWS documentation, `` For Amazon glacier,
storage costs are a consistent \$0.004 per gigabyte per month, which is
substantially cheaper than Amazon's own Simple Storage
Service''~\cite{hid-sp18-420-Amazon-Glacier-FAQ}. ``Customers can store data to
Amazon Glacier with a significant saving as compared to on-premise storage.
Amazon Glacier is designed to provide average annual durability of
99.999999999\% for an archive''~\cite{hid-sp18-420-Amazon-Glacier}. Data is
stored in Amazon Glacier as archives. Archives can be deleted at any point of
time and billing will be updated accordingly.

Amazon Glacier provides three options for access to archives, from a few minutes
to several hours. The AWS Management console is used for Amazon Glacier set up.
User can upload and retrieve data programmatically in later phases.
