\section{Metron}

Apache Metron is yet another open source project that serves as a big data
solution for CyberSecurity applications. It provides a framework to ingest,
process and also store data such as application logs, network logs and so on so
that can be analyzed by Information security teams so that they can detect
anomalies and respond to cyber threats. It provides the storage solution in the
form of security data lake or vault where the logs can be stored long term on
cost effective storage. In addition to SIEM or Security information and event
management features Metron also provides packet replay utilities which can be of
immense help for the security analysts.  Metron also support applying machine
learning algorithms on real time data that is being ingested through continuous
streams~\cite{hid-sp18-517-metron-apache}.  Apache Metron caters to personnels
at all levels in the CyberSecurity operations from CISO to SOC analyst to
security Data Scientist~\cite{hid-sp18-517-metron-hortonworks}.  It provides a
single view of the risk to CISO or Chief Information Security Officer while
automatically performs that analytics so security investigator does not have to
spend time on finding co-relation in the data. Metron also has the capability to
create incidents and can integrate with the ITSM or Information technology
service management systems to provide
traceability~\cite{hid-sp18-517-metron-hortonworks}.
