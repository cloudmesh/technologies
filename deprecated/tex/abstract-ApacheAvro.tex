\section{Apache Avro}

Avro~\cite{hid-sp18-421-AvroCloud} is a framework for data serialization, where
serialization is a process of translating object or data structure into a format
that can be stored. Apache Avro can translate very high datastructure formats.
It provides binary data format which is very fast and compact. Avro can also
provide Remote procedure calls.

Avro is completely based on schemas. Data is stored in file along with the
schema and can be read by any program, since schema is available when ever data
is read or written it can be used as dynamic scripting languages.

Avro differs from similar systems like Thrift, Protocol Buffers by schema
evaluation, untagged data and dynamic typing.
