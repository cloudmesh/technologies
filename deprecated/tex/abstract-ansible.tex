\section{Ansible}

Ansible is a widely popular open-source tool used for automation of
configuration management, application deployment. Ansible is popular
because of its simplicity. Originally, Ansible Inc was setup to manage
the product. Later in 2015, RedHat acquired Ansible.  ``It uses no
agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy
to deploy and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML,
in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your
automation jobs in a way that approaches plain
English''~\cite{hid-sp18-417-doc-Ansible}.  An user doesn't have to
learn a cryptic language to use it.  As no agents are required to be
installed in the nodes, the tool eases the network overhead. Ansible
may use two kinds of server for operation. One is the controlling
server that has Ansible installed.  The controlling server deploys
modules in the nodes through SSH channel.  The basic component of
Ansible archtecture are:

\begin{description}
\item[Modules:] This is the unit of work/task in Ansible. It
  can be written in any standard programming language
\item[Inventory:] Inventory is basically the nodes used
\item[Playbooks:] A play book in Ansible describes in simple
  language the infrastucture used for the deployment of the tool. This
  is written in YAML. 
\end{description}
