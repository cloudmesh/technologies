Fluentd is a data collector used by many organizations such as Amazon,
Microsoft, and Google\cite{hid-sp18-526-www-fluentd}. It is open source
and available on GitHub. Fluentd creates a layer of abstraction between the
source of the data and backend, known as the ``Unified Logging Layer''. This
centralized system of data collection ensures security and reliability. Logs
contain important information, but due to modern data sizes, they are no
longer for just human use. The purpose of the logging layer is to allow more
machine reading of logs as opposed to human reading.

In the logging layer, data is converted to json, then sent to the
backend. Fluentd has a plugin system for many different programs,
such as Python and Node.js. There are also custom versions of Fluentd in
production. Google, for example, uses their own version of fluentd as their
logging layer in conjuction with Google BigQuery. The Fluentd project also
includes ``Fluent Bit'' which is a data forwarding system.
