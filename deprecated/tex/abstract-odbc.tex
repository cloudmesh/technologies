Odbc is an R package which allows connectivity to commercial
databases, such as Oracle, and MS SQL
Server~\cite{hid-sp18-403-R-odbc}. It also permits connection to other
databases with odbc  (Open Database Connectivity) hooks, however other
packages simplify these connections~\cite{hid-sp18-403-R-dbi}.
Because \textit{odbc} is actaully a thin wrapper around the c++ ODBC
bindings, it is faster than any other common database
connecter~\cite{hid-sp18-403-rstudio-odbc}.
