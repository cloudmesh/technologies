BigML~\cite{hid-sp18-504-cloudacad-bigml} is a Machine Learning platform
focused on delivering a wide range of ML solutions, while aiming to provide
a simplified user experience. Considered as a MLaaS, BigML integrates with
most Cloud storage systems in order to load data and train machine learning
models to develop predictive insights. BigML is also platform-agnostic,
and can utilize existing cloud services, such as `AWS S3, MS Azure, Google Storage,
Google Drive, Dropbox, etc' in order to import data~\cite{hid-sp18-504-cloudacad-bigml}. 
The BigML platform can handle machine learning tasks such as classification
and regression, anomoly detction, cluster analysis, association discover, time series,
and topic modeling~\cite{hid-sp18-504-bigml}.

The platform also includes a large number of visualizations and offers both a Web UI
and API interfaces to deliver these machine learning services. The data sets are
reusable, and can be used to build a number of models and ensembles to improve
predictive performance. It is also possible to convert these models into procedural code
that is offered in various different languages and formats~\cite{hid-sp18-504-cloudacad-bigml}.
