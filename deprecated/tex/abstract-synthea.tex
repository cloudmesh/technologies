Synthea~\cite{hid-sp18-526-www-synthea} is an open-source medical patient
generator. Synthea allows for the full synthetic generation of medical patients
and patient records, which solves the privacy problems of using real-world
patient data. It also allows medical researchers to generate data on-demand
and test scaling, stress, etc. Synthea uses a Generic Model Framework (GMF) to
model and track disease progression as well. Each patient generated by Synthea
is a full-model: from birth to present with full demographics. This type of
data can be used for small and large-scale health analysis. The data underlying
these models are generated based on current academic research. Therefore,
the data can also be used to run analysis on the synthetic patients.

According to its website, Synthea is useful for ``Academic Research'', the
``Health IT Industry'', and ``Policy Formation''. Synthea is a product
of MITRE Corporation written in Java, and supports both C-CDA and FHIR
formats. It can also generate graphs using Graphviz.
