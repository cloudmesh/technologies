\section{Pulsar}

Apache Pulsar which is also an open source project of the Apache foundation was
originally developed by Yahoo. It is a messaging solution that enables high
performance server to server messaging.  Similar to Kafka Pulsar is based on
publisher-subscriber model.  Some of the key features of Pulsar include low
latency in publishing, guaranteed message delivery, scalability and so on.  The
publish-subscribe pattern involves components such as producers, consumers,
topics and subscription wherein; topics are channels that transmit data from
source to target or in other words from producers to consumers, producers job is
to publish a message and a consumer process is the one that receives the
message.  Subscriptions are set of rules that determine how messages flow in the
system from producers to consumers and have three modes namely exclusive,
failover and shared~\cite{hid-sp18-517-pulsar-apache}.  Pulsar can be installed
and run in standalone mode or standalone cluster, it can also be run multiple
clusters. Pulsar installation involves installing an instance which can be
installed across clusters when installed in multi-cluster environment. In this
setup clusters can be running within the data center or can span across multiple
data centers.  Pulsar also support geo-replication so the clusters can replicate
with each other. Pulsar can also be installed on Kubernetes on Google Kubernetes
or AWS~\cite{hid-sp18-517-pulsar-apache}.
