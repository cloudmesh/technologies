  abstract = {Voldemort is a distributed data store that is designed as a key-value store used by LinkedIn for high-scalability storage.[1] It is named after the fictional Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort. It supports a pluggable architecture which allows the support of multiple storage engines in the same framework. This allows us to integrate a fast, fault-tolerant online storage system, with the heavy offline data crunching running on Hadoop
