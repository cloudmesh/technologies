  abstract =     {The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an
                  in-depth analysis of different platforms available
                  for performing big data analytics. This paper
                  surveys different hardware platforms available for
                  big data analytics and assesses the advantages and
                  drawbacks of each of these platforms based on
                  various metrics such as scalability, data I/O rate,
                  fault tolerance, real-time processing, data size
                  supported and iterative task support. In addition to
                  the hardware, a detailed description of the software
                  frameworks used within each of these platforms is
                  also discussed along with their strengths and
                  drawbacks. Some of the critical characteristics
                  described here can potentially aid the readers in
                  making an informed decision about the right choice
                  of platforms depending on their computational
                  needs. Using a star ratings table, a rigorous
                  qualitative comparison between different platforms
                  is also discussed for each of the six
                  characteristics that are critical for the algorithms
                  of big data analytics. In order to provide more
                  insights into the effectiveness of each of the
                  platform in the context of big data analytics,
                  specific implementation level details of the widely
                  used k-means clustering algorithm on various
                  platforms are also described in the form
                  pseudocode.},
