  abstract =     {Thrift is a software library and set of
                  code-generation tools devel- oped at Facebook to
                  expedite development and implementation of efficient
                  and scalable backend services. Its primary goal is
                  to en- able efficient and reliable communication
                  across programming lan- guages by abstracting the
                  portions of each language that tend to require the
                  most customization into a common library that is
                  imple- mented in each language. Specifically, Thrift
                  allows developers to define datatypes and service
                  interfaces in a single language-neutral file and
                  generate all the necessary code to build RPC clients
                  and servers.  This paper details the motivations and
                  design choices we made in Thrift, as well as some of
                  the more interesting implementation details. It is
                  not intended to be taken as research, but rather it
                  is an exposition on what we did and why.},
