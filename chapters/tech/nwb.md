NWB provides researchers and educators access to multiple algorithms and
datasets. NWB allows users to make successive algorithm calls to create what is
called a Workflow. The Workflow is designed to handle the application end-to-
end, providing a framework for Data collection, Preprocessing, Analysis,
Modelling and Visualization. All these operations are done with ease via the
user-friendly Console window. The code library of NWB is basically just
insertion of plug-ins. Some plug-ins run the core architecture, while additional
plugins are also available for other problem specific algorithms. All the
derived and the parent datasets are displayed in the Data Manager window.
NWBs dexterity in data manipulation is exemplified by the Data Conversion
Service which facilitates the conversion between different file types. Models
such as Random Graph Model, Watts-Strogatz Small World etc. can be generated
using NWB, thus facilitating the creation of descriptive models of compatible
datasets. Tree Visualizations such as Tree View Visualization, Tree Map
Visualization, Balloon Graph Visualization etc. can be constructed over datasets
which are natively in the tree format. The GUI is user-friendly, allowing users
to set parameters such as size, color and shape for both the nodes and the
edges; meanwhile, the legend is auto-generated. NWB also has the capability to
produce various Graph Visualizations. Some of the Graph Visualizations available
are LaNet, JUNG-based Circular. Other than the built-in ability to create
visualizations, NWB also provides some integration with other tools such as
GUESS and Gnuplot. The whole network visualization or any specific view can be
saved in formats such as pdf, gif, raw, jpg or png [@fa18-523-69-www-researchgate].
