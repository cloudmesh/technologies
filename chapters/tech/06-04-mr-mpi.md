MR-MPI stands for Map Reduce-Message Passing Interface is open source
library build on top of standard MPI [@www-mapreducempi]. It
basically implements mapReduce operation providing a interface for
user to simplify writing mapReduce program.  It is written in C++ and
needs to be linked to MPI library in order to make the basic map
reduce functionality to be executed in parallel on distributed memory
architecture.  It provides interface for c, c++ and python. Using C
interface the library can also be called from Fortrain.
