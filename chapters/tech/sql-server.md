Microsoft SQL Server is a RDBMS system by Microsoft where RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. Its primary function is to store and retrieve data from the database as and when the software application request for it. It can be run in a single system or on a cloud to be accessed by several applications at once [@fa18-523-57-sql-server-wiki]. SQL server is being offered by Microsoft in several editions [@fa18-523-57-sql-server-editions] which can be seen in brief as below:


* Mainstream Editions:

  1. Standard Version:
  
     This edition has a core engine for the database, which can be used by individuals and the entire functionality of SQL server cannot be utilized in this version. It has a very basic level of data management options and enables efficient database management.
     
  2. Web Version:
  
     This is an edition which is used as a web-based database and has very limited functionality. It's a low-cost option for users making it affordable for small applications.
     
  3. Enterprise Version:
  
     This is a full version of SQL server which has the core engine service as well as the add-ons, it can support multiple users and can support memory addition during the database use. It has super-fast performance with unlimited space for virtualization and enables easier management of critical workloads.
     
  4. Business Intelligence Version:
  
     This version utilizes both the standard version and Business Intelligence tools like Power View, PowerPivot and so on. It combines the power of two, that is a reasonably fast database server and high-end business intelligence tools.
     
  5. Express Version:
  
     It's a free edition version of the SQL server which has the core engine and this version is scaled down but has access for multiple number of users and multiple instances of the database on a single processor. This version came into existence as a replacement for Microsoft SQL Data Engine. It is ideal for independent developers for building their applications as it can be installed faster and can be worked on immediately. This version can be upgraded without any hassles to higher versions of the same SQL Server.

  4. Compact SQL CE Version:
