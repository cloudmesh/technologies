Microsoft SQL Server is a RDBMS system by Microsoft where RDBMS stands
for Relational Database Management System [@www-fa18-523-57-sql-server-wiki]. 
Its primary function is to store and retrieve data from the database as and 
when the software application request for it. It can be run in a single 
system or on a cloud to be accessed by several applications at once
[@www-fa18-523-57-sql-server-wiki]. SQL server is being offered by
Microsoft in several editions [@www-fa18-523-57-sql-server-editions]
which can be seen in brief as below.

1. *Standard Version* edition has a core engine for the database, 
   which can be used by individuals and the entire functionality of SQL 
   server cannot be utilized in this version. It has a very basic level 
   of data management options and enables efficient database management.
   
2. *Web Version* edition is used as a web-based database and has very 
   limited functionality. It is a low-cost option for users making it 
   affordable for small applications.
   
3. *Enterprise Version* is a full version of SQL server which has the 
   core engine service as well as the add-ons, it can support multiple 
   users and can support memory addition during the database use. It 
   has super-fast performance with unlimited space for virtualization 
   and enables easier management of critical workloads.
   
4. *Business Intelligence Version* utilizes both the standard version 
   and Business Intelligence tools like Power View, PowerPivot and so on. 
   It combines the power of two, that is a reasonably fast database 
   server and high-end business intelligence tools.
   
5. *Express Version* is a free edition version of the SQL server which has 
   the core engine and this version is scaled down but has access for
   multiple number of users and multiple instances of the database
   on a single processor. It is ideal for independent developers for
   building their applications as it can be installed faster and can
   be worked on immediately.
