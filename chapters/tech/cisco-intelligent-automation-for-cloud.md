Cisco Intelligent automation for cloud desires to help different
service providers and software professionals in delivering highly
secure infrastructure as a service on demand. It provides a foundation
for organizational transformation by expanding the uses of cloud
technology beyond its infrastructure [@cis1]. From a single
self-service portal, it automates standard business processes and
sophisticated data center which is beyond the provision of virtual
machines. Cisco Intelligent automation for cloud is a unified cloud
platform that can deliver any type of service across mixed

penetration across different business and IT holdings. Its services
range from underlying infrastructure to anything-as-a-service by
allowing its users to evaluate, transform and deploy the IT and
