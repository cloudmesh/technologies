In the first quarter of 2013, Salesforce.com released its proprietary SQL-like 
interface and query engine for HBase, Phoenix, to the open source community. 
The company appears to have been motivated to develop Phoenix as a way to (1) 
increase accessibility to HBase by using the industry-standard query language
(SQL); (2) save users time by abstracting away the complexities of coding 
native 
HBase queries; and,(3) implementing query best practices by implementing them 
automatically via Phoenix [@www-phoenix-cloudera].
Although Salesforce.com initially open-sourced it via Github, by May of 2014 it 
had become a top-level Apache project [@www-phoenix-wikipedia].

In the first quarter of 2013, Salesforce.com released its proprietary SQL-like 
interface and query engine for HBase, *Phoenix*, to the open source community. 
The company appears to have been motivated to develop Phoenix as a way to (1) 
increase accessibility to HBase by using the industry-standard query language
(SQL); (2) save users time by abstracting away the complexities of coding 
native HBase queries; and, (3) implementing query best practices by

Phoenix, written in Java,compiles [SQL queries] into a series of HBase scans, 
and orchestrates the running of those scans to produce regular JDBC
result sets [@www-apachephoenix-org].


In addition, the program directs compute intense portions of the calls to the
 server.  For instance, if a user queried for the top ten records across 
 numerous regions from an HBase database consisting of a billion records,
 the program would first select the top ten records for each region using
 server-side compute resources. After that, the client would be tasked with
 selecting the overall top ten [@www-phoenix-salesforcedev].

Despite adding an abstraction layer, Phoenix can actually speed up queries 
because it optimizes the query during the translation process 
[@www-phoenix-cloudera]. For example, 'Phoenix beats Hive for a simple query 
spanning 10M-100M rows' [@www-phoenix-infoq].
   Another program can enhance HBase's accessibility for those inclined towards
   graphical interfaces.  SQuirell only requires the user to set up the JDBC 
   driver and specify the appropriate connection string 
   [@www-phoenix-bighadoop].

The Apache Phoenix work as SQL skin for Hbase. Phoenix provides the flexibility
 to write queries like SQL when we are working on Hadoop API data. 
The Phoenix applications can run Map Reduce jobs as per user request and 
utilize the big data fundamentals. Apache Phoenix is increasing popularity 
over other tools available in its space. The beauty is that Phoenix provides 
features such as skipping full table scan, improve performance of overall 
system [@books-google-com].

 By utilizing HBase as its storage database, Phoenix enable OLTP and analysis
 for lower latency applications in Hadoop by combining standard SQL and JDBC
 APIs with full ACID transaction capabilities. The Phoenix support easy 
 integration with other Hadoop ecosystem product like Hive 
 [@phoenix-apache-hive], Pig [@phoenix-apache-pig], Map Reduce 
 [@books-google-com].

 Phoenix framework provides the client and server libraries. Phoenix custom 
 HBase co-processor handle metadata management,transaction, join,indexing, 
 schema and  on server side.

 On Client end, Phoenix client library has parser, necessary relationship 
 algebra and query plan component that used to parse the given query and 
 choose the optimal plan based on cost-based optimization. 
 Once query plan chooses, Phoenix internally convert the request to SCAN, 
 PUT or DELETE operation and execute the operations [@www-thesisscientist].

The Java should be present on system with Hadoop to install Phoenix. The 
recent JDK V1.8.x JVM need for installation. The Hadoop and Phoenix can 
install on Windows, MAC, Linux systems [@www-apachephoenix-org].

 The table creation and versioned control supported by 	Apache Phoenix Schema.
 The HBase table maintains table metadata and versioned. The snapshot queries 
 will use the correct schema over prior versions.

A Phoenix table is created through the CREATE TABLE command and can either be:

1. built from scratch, in which case the HBase table and column families will
 be created automatically.
2. mapped to an existing HBase table, by creating either a read-write TABLE 
or a read-only VIEW, with the caveat that the binary representation of the 
row key and key values must match that of the Phoenix data types.
  - For a read-write TABLE, column families will be created automatically 
  if they don&#39;t already exist. An empty key value will be added to the 
  first column family of each existing row to minimize the size of the 
  projection for queries.
  - For a read-only VIEW, all column families must already exist. 
  The only change made to the HBase table will be the addition of the Phoenix 
  co-processors used for query processing. The primary use case for a
  VIEW is to transfer existing data into a Phoenix table, since data 
  modification are not allowed on a VIEW and query performance will likely
  be less than as with a TABLE [@www-apachephoenix-org].
