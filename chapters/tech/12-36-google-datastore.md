Google Cloud Datastore is a NoSQL document database built for
automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application
development [@www-google-datastore]. Though Cloud Datastore
interface has many of the features similar to traditional
databases,but as a NoSQL database, it differs from the SQL in the way
as it describes relationships between various data objects. It also
provides a number of features that relational databases are not
optimally suited to provide, including high-performance at a very
large scale and high-reliability. The Google Cloud DataStore can have
different kinds of properties for the same kind of entities, unlike
the Relational Database where they are represented in rows. For
example, the difference between entities can have the properties with
the same name but having different values. The flexible schema maps
naturally to object-oriented and scripting languages.

Non-relational databases have become popular recently, especially for
web applications that require high-scalability and performance with
high-availability. Non-relational databases such as Cloud DataStore
let developers to choose an optimal balance between strong consistency
and eventual consistency for each application. This allows developers
to combine the benefits of both the database
structures [@www-google-datastore-2].  Datastore is designed to
automatically scale to very large data sets, allowing applications to
maintain high performance as they receive more traffic. Datastore also
provides a number of features that relational databases are not
optimally suited to provide, including high-performance at a very
large scale and high-reliability [@www-google-datastore].
