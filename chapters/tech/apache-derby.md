Apache Derby is an Apache database sub-project designed based on java, SQL and 
JDBC standards [@www-apache-derby].
> "Apache Derby (previously distributed as IBM Cloudscape) is a
> relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by the
> Apache Software Foundation that can be embedded in Java programs and
> used for online transaction processing" [@www-derby-wiki].

Relational database systems have long been popular among developers to
store data. It popularity stems from the fact that information between
various tables can be linked together using keys that uniquely
identify any atom in a table. Not to mention that RDBMS provide easy
to manage data. Examples of RDBMS include MS SQL [@www-ms-sql-server],
Oracle [@www-oracle-database], Derby [@www-apache-derby] etc.

Derby is implemented completely in Java. Devices that make use of the
Java Micro edition can take full advantage of Derby, given the fact
that it only leaves about 2MB as footprint for both the embedded JDBC
driver and the base engine. It requires no maintenance (until the
application changes), and hence can be embedded in applications
written in Java, where details are hidden from the user.  Derby runs
on most OSs including windows, AIX, solaris, UNIX and Mas OS.

In the famous book Apache Derby - Off to the Races by Zikopoulos,
Baklarz, and Scott (2005), the authors are of the view that

> "not all client/server or Web applications require the muscle of an
> enterprise-class infrastructure database" [@inbook-derby-book].

Only about 20-30% of applications actually require RDBMS
capabilities. Furthermore, their hosting environments usually do not
have the system requirements to run full-fledged data engines. Note
that these systems still need robustness and scalability to ensure
data integrity and this is where Apache derby comes in. Another,
benefit of using Derby is that it eliminates the use of a database
administrator. The DB can be managed programmatically from the
application itself [@inbook-derby-book].

The following scenarios describe instances where Derby could be the
suitable choice:

1. Small business client database applications: Eliminating the need
   for a DBA can significantlly reduce costs
2. Local registries and repositories: Since the DB is fully
   transactional, developers need not worry about crashes that can
   destroy configuration files.
3. Small business client/server and Web-based applications: To build
   websites low on maintenance but high on reliability.  This ensures
   that businesses have plenty of head room for seasonal spikes.
