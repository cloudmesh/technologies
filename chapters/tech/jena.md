ILLEAGL QUOTES

Jena is an open source Java Framework provided by Apache for semantic
web applications ([@www-w3-jena]). It provides a programmatic
environment for RDF, RDFS and OWL, SPARQL, GRDDL, and includes a
rule-based inference engine. Semantic web data differs from
conventional web applications in that it supports a web of data
instead of the classic web of documents format. The presence of a rule
based inference engine enable Jena to perform a reasoning based on OWL
and RDFS ontologies [@www-trimc-nlp-blogspot]. ` The architecture
of Jena contains three layers: Graph layer, model layer and Ontology
layer. The graph layer forms the base for the architecture. It does
not have an extensive RDF implementation and serves more as a Service
provider Interface. It provides classes/methods that could be further
extended [@www-trimc-nlp-blogspot].  The model layer extends the
graph layer and provides objects of type 'resource' instead of 'node'
to work with.  The ontology layer enables one to work with triples.
