In 2000 HP Labs began developing Jena and in 2010 Jena became part of the
Apache Software Foundation [@fa18-523-56-www-Jena-whatisJena]. Jena is open
source and written in Java. Jena is a tool for the semantic web with Java 
libraries and APIs to develop tool and applications. Key distinguishes for 
Jena is its support of OWL and tools to publish RDF data. The semantic web, 
sometimes called web 3.0, is based on a concept of storing data 
differently than conventional relational databases. Storing data in RDF 
triples allows linkages between data that might otherwise remain disconnected. 
Jena is an application that provides the tools to help developers build 
applications to store, query and organize data in this RDF triples format.

There are several key elements to Jena that are best understood with a basic 
understanding of RDF. RDF or Resource Description Framework is a way to model 
and connect resources or objects. The building blocks in RDF are triples. 
Triples are built specifically in the Subject.Predicate.Object format. 
An example of a triple would be `Wine.Color.Red` The data model that is 
created storing data this way becomes a semantic graph. Jena is built to 
provide tools to work with RDF and the semantic web. Jena has some key 
libraries and capabilities that are key for developers buying into 
building applications in the ontological model. Jena RDF API is key to 
reading and building triples and RDF graphs. The Jena RDF API provides the 
basic create, read, update and delete functionality for dealing with triples 
in RDF. The Jena ARQ processor is another important tool in Jena's tool kit 
that enables query using SPARQL [@fa18-523-56-www-Jena-ARQquery]. 
On other key distinguisher of Jena is its support for OWL. OWL or the Web 
Ontology Language is way represent and build semantics of data similar but
more extensible than RDF [@fa18-523-56-www-Jena-OWL-introduction].
