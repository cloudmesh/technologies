HTCondor is a specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs.  HTCondor provides various features like (a) job
queuing mechanism, (b) scheduling policy, (c) resource monitoring,
(d) priority scheme and (e) resource management just as other
full-featured batch systems.

HTCondor
can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute nodes. HTCondor
uses unique mechanisms to harness wasted CPU power from idle desktop
workstations.
