The SaltStack is a management platform for centralized server infrastructure with configuration management, remote execution, monitoring and other functions, so it is just a simplified version of the puppet and enhanced version of the functions. [@fa18-523-86-www--Saltstack-Wiki]

SaltStack is based on the Python language and is built with message queues (ZeroMQ) and Python third-party modules (Pyzmq, PyCrypto, Pyjinjia2, python-msgpack, and PyYAML). By deploying the SaltStack environment, users can execute commands in batches on thousands of servers, configure centralized management, distribute files, collect server data, operating system infrastructure, and package management based on different type of businesses. SaltStack is a good tool to improve work efficiency, standardize business configuration and operation. [@fa18-523-86-www--Saltstack-Intro]

SaltStack is very fast and simple to configure and maintain for different size of project and any number of servers, or for local network or a cross-data center, can manage any number of servers with diverse needs. One core features of SaltStack for parallel remote node execution commands. it uses a lot of new techniques, the network layer uses the ZeroMQ library, it also uses public and master communications, while using faster AES encryption communications, so authentication and encryption are already integrated into SaltStack. For easy extensions, the SaltStack execution routine can be written as a simple Python module and it is based on the Apache 2.0 licence and can be used for open source or proprietary projects.
