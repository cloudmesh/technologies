It can be viewed as a closed
source database that is used for storage and retrieval of data in the
form of triples (triple is a data entity composed of
subject-predicate-object like *Professor teaches students*).
Information in a triple store is retrieved using a query
language. Query languages can be classified into database query
languages or information retrieval query languages. The difference is
that a database query language gives exact answers to exact questions,
while an information retrieval query language finds documents
containing requested information.  Triple format represents
information in a machine-readable format.  Every part of the triple is
individually addressable via unique URLs - for example, the statement
*Professor teaches students* might be represented in RDF (Resource
Description Framework). Using this representation, semantic data can
be queried [@www-Allegrow].
