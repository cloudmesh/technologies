It is powerful and full-featured enough to develop triple-A,
current-gen console games and is deeply integrated with AWS and Twitch
(an online steaming service) [@gamasutra]. Lumberyard's core
engine technology is based on Crytek's CryEngine [@hands]. The
goal is

> ``creating experiences that embrace the notion of a player,
> broadcaster, and viewer all joining together ''

[@gamasutra]. Monetization for Lumberyard will come
strictly through the use of Amazon Web Services' cloud computing. If
you use the engine for your game, you're permitted to roll your own
server tech, but if you're using a third-party provider, it has to be
Amazon [@what].
