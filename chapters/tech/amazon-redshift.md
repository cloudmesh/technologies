Amazon Redshift [fa18-423-06-www-Amazon-Redshift] is a data warehouse that is
not only a columnar data store, but it uses massively parallel processing (MPP)
[@fa18-423-06-www-Redshift-Review]. Amazon boasts that the Redshift software is
a fast, scalable, and cost-effective way to analyze and store data
[@fa18-423-06-www-Redshift-Video]. Most importantly, Amazon wants people to 
know that this software is fast and in the cloud. Unlike most data warehouses 
used in business, the Amazon Redshift software is constantly monitored by 
Amazon for a cheaper alternative to storing and accessing data.

In 2012, major data warehouse vendor ParAccel announced that Amazon had become a
major investor in their company. Then, later in the year, Amazon came out with
Amazon Redshift, which was very similar to the ParAccel technology
[@fa18-423-06-www-Amazon-ParAccel]. The software is able to work without having
to implement a new programming language.

The cluster that Amazon is referring to is the massively parallel processing
that is the backbone of the data warehouse. MPP means using multiple processors
and computers to perform computations in coordination
[@fa18-423-06-Redshift-Review]. These clusters are the only way to move data
through the data warehouse, a single node cannot be sent. Every cluster is made
up of a leader, then nodes are in place behind that leader
[@fa18-423-06-Redshift-Review]. These clusters are what gives Redshift the
ability to query quickly in parallel. The structure of the data gives the Amazon
Redshift software the ability to be scaled up as the business grows, a major
issue for businesses who grow quickly.

One of the major points that Amazon wants clients to know about Redshift is that
the scalability, encryption, and maintenance is performed in the cloud by Amazon
for a meager price of around $1k per terabyte per year
[@fa18-423-06-www-Redshift-Video]. These factors are one of the main reasons
that Redshift has been one of the fastest growing products in Amazon Web
Service's portfolio [@fa18-423-06-Redshift-Review]. Amazon's data warehouse
service is sure to be one of the best and most convenient ways to store data, no
matter the size of the business.
