DreamLab is app only based service developed and propagated by Vodafone Australia that helps to solve cancer problems. Since cancer has become a major problem in the world and billions of dollars are spent every year for medical treatment and diagnosis, it is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed in various possible ways, especially using technology advancements and DreamLab is one of those many ways, using mobile as platform. The researchers analyze genomic patterns like genetic mutations of cancer patients and cluster them based on their pattern. DreamLab helps to support major cancers like breast, prostate in the initial state. Later, the project is expected to be developed to support all 24 types of cancers. The genomic sequencing is a task that involves huge giga bytes of data and requires huge computational power like GPUs [@fa18-523-79-Vodafone-Australia]. Since the access to such resources is very limited and involves high cost, Vodafone has developed DreamLab that enables users to donate processing power of their smartphones, which can be used for cancer research on hands. This is similar to distributed computing on cloud [@fa18-523-79-Vodafone-Red-Wire]. It uses Network connectivity analyzer algorithm, developed by the Gravan Institute of Medical Research. The algorithm calculates various statistics of genomic interactions between different sets of genes. This can help find patterns in the groups or individuals who share similar genomic mutations by using big data. The app requests research job on phone to AWS Amazon Cognito and the job is handled by AWS DynamoDB. This way, the computational power of smartphones of several users can be used for performing the algorithm process to solve the cancer research problem. Once the computations are done and any similarities in genomic mutations or patterns are detected, the results are sent from app to Graven research team, where they use the data and findings for analysis and research. As per the Graven research study, 33 android devices would be able to process the task at as much speed as Graven super computer and also with over 50000 plus active app users and the total computational power available to them is almost 900 times that of Graven Research super computer [@fa18-523-79-AWS-News-Blog].
