DREAM:Lab stands for ``Distributed Research on Emerging Applications
and Machines Lab'' [@dream]. DREAM:Lab is centered around
distributed systems research to enable expeditious utilization of
distributed data and computing systems [@dream]. DREAM:Lab
utilizes the ``capabilities of hundereds of personal computers'' to
allow access to supercomputing resources to average
individuals [@rao]. The DREAM:Lab pursues this goal by utilizing
distributed computing [@rao].  Distributed computing consists of
independent computing resources that communicate with each other over
a network [@denero]. A large, complex computing problem is broken
down into smaller, more manageable tasks and then these tasks are
distributed to the various components of the distributed computing
system [@denero].
