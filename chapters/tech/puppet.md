Puppet is an open source software configuration management
tool [@www-puppet-wiki-puppet].This aims at automatic
configuration of the software applications and infrastructure. This
configuration is done using the easy to use languge.  Puppet works on
major linux distributions and also on microsoft windows, it is also
cross-platform application making it easy to manage and
portable [@www-puppet-puppet-site].

Puppet works with a client server model. All the clients (nodes)
which needs to be managed will have 'Puppet Agent' installed and
'Puppet Master' contains the configuration for different hosts this
demon process rund on master server. The connection between 'Puppet
Master' and 'Puppet agent' will be established using the secured SSL
connection. The configuration at client will be validated as per the
set up in Puppet master at a predefined interval. If configuration at
client is not matching with the master puppet agent fetches the
changes from master [@www-puppet-slashroot].

Puppet is developed by Puppet Labs using ruby language and released as
GNU General Public License (GPL) until version 2.7.0 and the Apache
License 2.0 after that [@www-puppet-wiki-puppet].
