Flume is distributed, reliable and available service for efficiently
collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log
data [@www-apache-flume]. Flume was created to allow you to flow data
from a source into your Hadoop environment.  In Flume, the entities
you work with are called sources, decorators, and sinks. A source can
be any data source, and Flume has many predefined source adapters. A
sink is the target of a specific operation. A decorator is an
operation on the stream that can transform the stream in some manner,
which could be to compress or uncompress data, modify data by adding
or removing pieces of information, and more [@ibm-flume].
