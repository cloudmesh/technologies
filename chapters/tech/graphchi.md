GraphChi is a disk-based system for computing efficiently on graphs
with large number of edges.  It uses a well-known method to break
large graphs into small parts, and executes data mining, graph mining,
machine learning algorithms. GraphChi can process over one hundred
thousand graph updates per second, while simultaneously performing
computation [@GraphChi]. GraphChi is a spin-off of the
GraphLab. GraphChi brings web-scale graph computation, such as
analysis of social networks, available to anyone with a modern laptop
