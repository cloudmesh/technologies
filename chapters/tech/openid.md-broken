OpenID is an authentication protocol that allows users to log in to
different websites, which are not related, using the same login
credentials for each, i.e. without having to create separate id and
password for all the websites. The login credentials used are of the
existing account. The password is known only to the identity provider
and nobody else which relieves the users' concern about identity being
known to an insecure website. [@ope1] It provides a mechanism that
makes the users control the information that can be shared among
multiple websites. OpenID is being adopted all over the web. Most of
the leading organizations including Microsoft, Facebook, Google,
etc. are accepting the OpenIDs [@ope2]. It is an open source and
not owned by anyone. Anyone can use OpenID or be an OpenID provider
and there is no need for an individual to be approved.





mgm3IU's summary review (Mark Miller, FA18-523-63):

Similarly to LDAP (Light-Weight Directory Acces Protocol), OpenID is
an authentication protocol service that is intended to ensure identity
protection for usage in software and corporate environments. A goal of
OpenID is to fight both sides of the battle between convenience and
security when it comes to information and its protection and
privacy. Software such as OpenID is essential to ensure the integrity
of data and protect against any attacks that may come from unwanted
sources.

The technology uses *end-user* interactions with a relying party with
the intention of validating that user’s identity. This service uses
the internet and DNS services to identify source and destination of
information and interactions with datasets, among other applications
of the software. It utilizes several checksum verification processes
and identifiers to ensure a user’s identity.

OpenID is a part of NetMesh Inc and is built using Solaris hardware
and software, in concert with VeriSign. There have been many attempted
attacks on OpenID and it is has been found to be susceptible to many
kinds of phishing attacks. Spoofing attacks have also been successful
against OpenID. Successful highjacking efforts have taken place over
unsecured connections. Data is stored in a JSON format which further
enables usability by JavaScript clients and users. Encryption,
identity protection, and session management are also supported. There
is a management console that alerts administrators of faults or
security breaches as they are recognized.

OpenID came to respect in 2005 after it initially being named Yadis
(Yet another distributed identity system) (Live Journal Server,
2009). It has powerful connections and similarities to other identity
authorities to ensure that the newest and most secure technologies are
used and implemented correctly. OpenID’s biggest competitor is a
service called OAuth, which is less intensive on user information and
doesn’t qualify as an authentication protocol. OpenID supports many
applications, including REST-like queries.
