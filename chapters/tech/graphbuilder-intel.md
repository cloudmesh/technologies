Intel GraphBuilder for Apache Hadoop V2 is a software that is used to
build graph data models easily enabling data scientists to concentrate
more on the business solution rather than preparing/formatting the
data. The software automates (a) Data cleaning, (b) transforming data and
(c) creating graph models with high throughput parallel processing using
hadoop, with the help of prebuilt libraries. Intel Graph Builder helps
to speed up the time to insight for data scientists by automating
heavy custom workflows and also by removing the complexities of
cluster computing for constructing graphs from Big Data. Intel Graph
Building uses Apache Pig scripting language to simplify data
preparation pipeline.

> "Intel Graph Builder also includes a connector that parallelizes
> the loading of the graph output into the Aurelius Titan open source
> graph database - which further speeds the graph processing pipeline
> through the final stage".

Finally being an open source there is a possibility of adding a load
of functionalities by various contributors [@graphbuilder].
