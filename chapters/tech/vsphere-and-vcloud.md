Old text   

vSphere was developed by VMware and is a cloud computing
virtualization platform [@www-vmware]. vSphere is not one piece of
software but a suite of tools that contains software such as vCenter,
ESXi, vSphere client and a number of other technologies. ESXi server
is a type 1 hypervisor on a physical machine of which all virtual
machines are installed.  The vSphere client then allows administrators
to connect to the ESXi and manage the virtual machines.  The vCenter
server is a virtual machine that is also installed on the ESXi server
which is used in environments when multiple ESXi servers exist.
Similarly, vCloud is also a suite of applications but for establishing
an infrastructure for a private cloud [@www-mustbegeek]. The suite
includes the vsphere suite, but also contains site recovery management
for disaster recovery, site networking and security.  Additionally, a
management suite that can give a visual of the infrastructure to
determine where potential issues might arise.

First of all, vSphere is a platform for today's combined cloud services. It is so efficient and secure that it can catch up with the updating requirements while providing service to the new scenarios.   

>"vSphere provides a powerful, flexible, and secure foundation for business agility that accelerates your digital transformation to hybrid cloud and success in the digital economy" [@fa18-523-85-vsphere].   

In some cases, the structure of the cloud may be too complex to analyze, let alone adding or integrating new modules in it. With vSphere, people are able to support the new work requirements easily. Besides, security is also one feature of vSphere since it could protect your data from stealing, destroying or unexpected updating. In the hybrid cloud environment, vSphere could be a powerful tool to help you manage the applications in a secure way. New updates of vSphere including better support to machine learning and data visualization, faster feedback to the unexpected issues of the data.   

>"The vSphere is the infrastructural level of the VMWare virtualization platform. The vSphere is IT controlled layer of virtualization, IT carefully constructs the virtualization of networks, servers, and other network resources through a planned vSphere architecture" [@fa18-523-85-stack-vsphere].   

The vCloud layer is a higher level concept which enables the enterprise deploying a flowing supporting model. In most cases, vSphere is a stable module, to satisfy the security requirements of company systems, vCloud was designed to operate servers and networks in a quite short time period.   

>"VMware vCloud Suite is an enterprise-ready private cloud software that brings together the industry-leading VMware vSphere hypervisor and VMware vRealize Suite cloud management platform" [@fa18-523-85-vcloud].   

vSphere is focusing on the security requirements of information technologies since enterprise cares lots about the safety of their data. vCloud is designed to boost the flows of the support of services. The reason why vCloud is located in a higher level than vSphere lies on the functions of vCloud. It enables the vSphere to work smoothly by ensuring the basic safe environment of the vSphere.
