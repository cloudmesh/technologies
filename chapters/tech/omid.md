Omid is a

> "flexible, reliable, high performant and scalable ACID
> transactional framework" [@www-apacheomid]

for NoSQL databases,
developed by Yahoo for HBase and contributed to the Apache community
Most NoSQL databases, do not natively support ACID transactions. Omid
employs a lock free approach from concurrency and can scale beyond
100,000 transactions per second. At Yahoo, millions of transactions
per day are processed by Omid [@www-yahooomid].

Omid is currently in the Apache Incubator.  All projects accepted by
the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) undergo an incubation period
until a review indicates that the project meets the standards of other
ASF projects [@www-apacheomid]
