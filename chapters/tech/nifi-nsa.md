NiFi is a customizable tool for building flexible data flows while
preserving data provenance and security
[@fa18-523-56-www-nifi-nifihomepage]. NiFi provides the ability to
build or alter an ETL flow with a few clicks. NiFi builds Gets,
Converts, and Pulls in a GUI and allows the user to build and
customize the flow [@fa18-523-56-www-nifi-issartetlsimple]. This
flexibility and usability is key to NiFis value in a big data world
where stovepipes and inflexibility are frequently challenges.

In the world of big data ETL, or Extract Transform and Load, is a
prevalent in most big date projects or architecture. If the data being
used is in the perfect format and structure, and the data is housed or
collected in the ideal location for the end use of the data, then ETL
may be superfluous. Otherwise Extract Transform and Load concepts will
come into play. However, enabling ETL is frequently more difficult
than it sounds. Data moving between systems effectively is tricky to
setup and challenging to refactor on the fly when conditions
change. NiFi was first developed at the National Security Agency but was
released as open source project to the public.

Since then, Apache Foundation has used it's volunteer organization to
grow and mature the project [@fa18-523-56-www-nifi-issartetlsimple].
NiFi incorporates a straightforward UI to engineer traceable data
provence with configurable components. NiFi offers up the ability to
custom build processors and incorporate them into a highly

NiFi seeks to automate data flows in a big data environment and give
architects the ability to keep data flowing between evolving systems
quickly. Amongst a host of features NiFi offers, one sticks out as
particularly important because of the challenges associated with what
the feature addresses: data errors, data inconsistency, and data
irregularity handling. NiFi provides users the ability to incorporate
in the flow processes to catch these non-happy path realities in big
data. As new situations are discovered a user can quickly build
if-then forks in the process to catch, store, or resolve the data
issues.
