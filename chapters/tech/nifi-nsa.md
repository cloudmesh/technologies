NiFi can be descibed as

> ``An Easy to use, powerful and reliable system to process and
> distribute data'' [@www-nifi].

This tool aims at
automated data flow from sources with different sizes, formats and
following different protocols to the centralized location or
destination [@www-hortanworks].
    
This comes equipped with an easy use UI where the data flow can be
controlled with a drag and a drop.  NiFi was initially developed by
NSA (called Niagarafiles) using the concepts of flow-based programming
and latter submitted to Apache Software foundation [@www-forbes].
