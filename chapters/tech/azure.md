Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) markets its cloud products under the
*Azure* brand name. At its most basic, Azure acts as an
*infrastructure- as-a-service* (IaaS) provider.  IaaS virtualizes
hardware components, a key differentiation from other *-as-a-service*
products. IaaS

> ``abstracts the user from the details of infrastructure like
> physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling,
> security, backup, etc'' [@www-wikipedia-cloud].

However, Azure offers a host of closely-related tool and products to
enhance and improve the core product, such as raw block storage, load
balancers, and IP addresses [@www-azure-msft]. For instance, Azure
users can access predictive analytics, Bots and
Blockchain-as-a-Service as well as more-basic computing, networking,
storage, database and management
components [@www-sec-edgar-msft] [@www-azure-msft].  The Azure
website shows twelve major categories under *Products* and twenty
*Solution* categories, e.g., e-commerce or Business SaaS apps.

Azure competes against Amazon's *Amazon Web Service*, even though IBM
(*SoftLayer* and *Bluemix*) and Google (*Google Cloud Platform*)
offer IaaS to the market [@www-aws-amzn, www-softlayer-ibm,
  www-bluemix-ibm,www-cloud-google].  As of January 2017, Azure's
datacenters span 32 Microsoft-defined *regions*, or 38 *declared
regions*, throughout the world [@www-azure-msft].
