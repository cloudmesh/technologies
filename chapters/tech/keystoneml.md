A framework for building and deploying large-scale machine-learning
pipelines within Apache Spark. It captures and optimizes the
end-to-end large-scale machine learning applications for
high-throughput training in a distributed environment with a
high-level API [@sparks2016keystoneml]. This approach increases
ease of use and higher performance over existing systems for large
scale learning [@sparks2016keystoneml]. It is designed to be a
faster and more sophisticated alternative to SparkML, the machine
learning framework that's a full member of the Apache Spark
club. Whereas SparkML comes with a basic set of operators for
processing text and numbers, KeystoneML includes a richer set of
operators and algorithms designed specifically for natural language
processing, computer vision, and speech processing [@building]. It
has enriched set of operations for complex domains:vision,NLP,Speech,
plus,advanced math And is Integrated with new BDAS technologies:
Velox, ml-matrix, soon Planck, TuPAQ and Sample Clean [@spark].
