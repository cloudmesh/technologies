Ubuntu MaaS (Metal as a Service) allows a user to deploy and manage
physical hardware.  Similar to IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
applications Ubuntu MaaS provides the capabilities to configure nodes,
install a preferred OS and install applications
[@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Blog].  The difference is in the level of detail the
user has access to. IaaS typically refers to the configuration of
virtual machines, meaning that the user does not have access to the
actual infrastructure [@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Stackexchange].  With Ubuntu
MaaS data center managers have the capability to configure key details
of individual servers for optimal
performance. [@fa18-523-84-MaaS-HomePage]

Ubuntu MaaS works by utilizing a tiered architecture of region nodes
and rack nodes that are used to manage the hardware
[@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Howitworks].  The region controller deals with
requests and works with the rack controller.  The rack controller
provides local services and also cashes the operating system image
[@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Howitworks].  Ubuntu MaaS also provides high
availability at the database level.  To achieve this the region
controller automatically switches gateways in the event of a rack
controller failure [@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Howitworks].  In addition, Ubuntu
MaaS allows grouping of machines to create physical availability
zones.  This allows the service to scale and helps streamline the
deployment of complex solutions [@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Howitworks].

Ubuntu MaaS manages the implementation of a new node through a process
called "The node lifecycle" [@fa18-523-84-MaaS-Howitworks].  The first
step is to bring the hardware into the ecosystem and to take an
inventory of the physical components at its disposal.  Next, the set
up phase gets the server ready for deployment.  Once the set up phase
is complete the server can be deployed or retired.

> "MAAS is designed for devops at scale, in places where bare metal is
  the best way to run your app. Big data, private cloud, PAAS and HPC
  all thrive on MAAS." [@fa18-523-84-MaaS-HomePage]

Ubuntu MaaS was designed for situations where the user is managing a
physical data center and where flexibility, control and efficiency are
important.  IaaS is similar to MaaS and is ideal for setting up
virtual machines in a cloud environment.  Some had questions about the
need for Ubuntu MaaS due to these similarities
[@fa18-523-84-techcrunch].  However, as the product developed it has
become a useful tool for data center mangers.
