Protocol Buffer [@www-protobuf] is a way to serialize structured
data into binary form (stream of bytes) in order to transfer it over
wires or for storage. It is used for inter application communication
or for remote procedure call (RPC). It involves a interface
description that describes the structure of some data and a program
that can generate source code or parse it back to the binary form. It
emphasizes on simplicity and performance over xml. Though xml is more
readable but requires more resources in parsing and storing.  This is
developed by Google and available under open source licensing. The
parser program is available in many languages including java and
python.
