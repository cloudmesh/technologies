Google Cloud Storage is the cloud enabled storage offered by
Google [@www-google-cloud-storage]. It is unified object
storage. To have high availability and performance among different
regions in the geo-redundant storage offering. If you want high
availability and redundancy with a single region one can go for
*Regional* storage. Nearline and Coldline' are the different
archival storage techniques. *Nearline* storage offering is for
the archived data which the user access less than once a
month. *Coldline* storage is the storage which is used for the
data which is touched less than once a year.

All the data in Google Cloud storage belongs inside a project. A
project will contains different buckets. Each bucket has different
objects. We need to make sure that the name of the bucket is unique
across all Google cloud name space. And the name of the objects should
unique in a bucket.
