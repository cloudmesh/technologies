Rya is a

> "scalable system for storing and retrieving RDF data in a cluster
> of nodes" [@Punnoose].

RDF stands for Resource
Description Framework [@Punnoose]. RDF is a model that facilitates
the exchange of data on a network [@www-rdf]. RDF utilizes a form
commonly referred to as a triple, an object that consists of a
subject, predicate, and object [@Punnoose].  These triples are
used to describe resources on the Internet [@Punnoose]. Through
new storage and querying techniques, Rya aims to make accessing RDF
data fast and easy [@www-apache-rya].
