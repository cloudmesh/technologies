SaltStack (also Salt) platform is a Python-based open-source
configuration management software and remote execution engine, which
makes systems and configuration management software for the
orchestration and automation of CloudOps, ITOps and DevOps at
scale [@www-saltstack]. SaltStack is used to manage all the data
center things including any cloud, infrastructure, virtualization,
application stack, software or code. Salt is built on two major
concepts -- remote execution and configuration
management [@SaltStack-book]. In the remote execution system, Salt
leverages Python to accomplish complex tasks with single-function
calls. The configuration management system in Salt, called States,
builds upon the remote execution foundation to create repeatable,
enforceable configuration for the minions (connects to the master and
treats the master as the source)
