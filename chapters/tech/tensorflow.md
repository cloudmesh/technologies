:o: in addition to videos you need to provide refrences to written documentation. The vide is just suplemental

TensorFlow [:o: ref missing] is a software library that utilize dataflow that is most commonly
used for training model especially in Deep Learning and neural networks which
evolves around mathematical computation. Computation is done through the
dataflow structure where Tensors, the data itself, are being passed to nodes,
which perform mathematical computation, and each nodes are connected by edges,
indicate the flow of the Tensors [@fa18-423-02-youtube-edureka-tensorflow].
 
Computation in Tensorflow is being mapped into different cluster of machines
which are not limited to only desktop machines and server, but also different
CPUs and GPUs of mobile devices [@fa18-423-02-tensorflow2015-whitepaper]. As
such, Tensorflow APIs are available in multiple programming language such as
Python, Javascript, C++, Java, Go, and Swift. This framework, datafow, is most
commonly used especially for parallel computing that gives certain advatages:
1) distribution execution, allowing Tanserflow to distribute loads after
partition to different machines, 2) compilation, which increases the performance
speed by combining multiple operations of the same flow, and 3) portability,
which allows the program to run on multiple languages
[@fa18-423-02-tensorflow-graph].

Tensorflow, with a strong training model framework, has been utilized in
variery of use case by developers coming from multiple field of interests. For
instance, the use image recognition in health industry which utilize Deep
Learning to learn about retina of diabetes patients. Doctors then use this model
to predict the likelyhood of patients who have similar retina orientation
whether they have diabetes. Another use case is in biology field where scientist
keep track of almost extinct species using drones to capture millions of videos
and images in large area. Therefore, the automation that TensorFlow provide
allows developers to scale their research utilizing its Machine Learning
