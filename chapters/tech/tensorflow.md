TensorFlow is a platform that provides a software library for
expressing and executing machine learning algorithms.vTensorFlow has a
flexible architecture allowing it to be executed with minimal change
to many heterogeneous systems such as CPUs and GPUs of mobile devices,
desktop machines, and serversc\cite{tensorflow-paper-2016}.
TensorFlow can

> ``express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and
> inference algorithms for deep neural netowrk models, and it has been
> used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning
> systems into production across more than a dozen areas''.

TensorFlow utilizes data flow graphs in which the

> ``nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the
> graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)
> communicated between them'' [@www-tensorflow].

TensorFlow was developed by the
Google Brain Team and has a reference implementation that was released
on 2015-11-09 under the Apache 2.0 open source license.
