EHCACHE is an open-source Java-based cache. It supports distributed
caching and could scale to hundred of caches. It comes with REST APIs
and could be integrated with popular frameworks like
Hibernate [@www-ehcache-features]. It offers storage tires such
that less frequently data could be moved to slower
tires [@www-ehcache-documentation]. It is XA compliant and supports
two- phase commit and recovery for transactions. It is developed and
maintained by Terracotta and is available under Apache 2.0 license.
It conforms to Java caching standard JSR 107.
