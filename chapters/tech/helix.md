Helix is a cluster management tool developed by Apache. We run a distributed
system on multiple nodes as it provides us scalability, fault tolerance and
ability of load balancing in case of a fault so that the system performance
doesn't suffer. In a cluster managed distributed system, the primary functions
performed by the nodes include data storage and producing data streams to be
used further etc. Helix makes decisions for a cluster-based system which
requires end to end coordination between the clusters and knowledge of the
entire architecture. Helix enables an automatic management of clusters by
replicating and partitioning the resources that are required by each cluster.
Helix models a distributed system using the concepts of Automated Finite State
machines and transitions [@fa18-523-62-helix-apache]. It enables fault reporting
and takes part in the recovery. Helix monitors the overall health of the cluster
and gives out timely alerts and provides automatic load balancing which is
extremely important in today's IT because of the strict adherence to the SLAs.
It reacts to any changes that occur within the system and comes up with a plan
to bring the system back to initial stable condition. Helix also has a
centralized configuration management, so an administrator doesn't need to modify
the configuration at every node at the time of deployment. Helix is being widely
used in the LinkedIn ecosystem to manage its backend system Espresso, instant
messaging feature of Instagram, Uber uses Helix extensively in the data delivery
system to move data to Kafka, HBase and HDFS. Turn uses Helix in the key value
store to manage partitions and automate migration process in case there is a
change in the number of machines in a cluster [@fa18-523-62-cwiki-apache].
Currently more work is being done to allow Helix to perform task management
operations and integrate with other resource management systems.
