Helix is a data management system getting developed by IBM which helps
the users to do explicatory analysis of the data received from various
sources following different formats. This system would help organize
the data by providing links between data collected across various
sources despite of the knowledge of the data sources schemas. It also
aims at providing the data really required for the user by extracting
the important information from the data. This would plan to target the
issue by maintaining the *knowledge base of schemas* and
*context-dependent dynamic linkage*, The system can get the schema
details either from the knowledge base being maintained or can even
get the schema from the data being received. As the number of users
for helix increases the linkages gets stronger and would provide
better data quality [@www-ibm-helix-paper].
