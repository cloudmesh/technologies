High Performance ParallelX (HPX-5) is an open source, distributed
model that provides opportunity for operations to run unmodified on
one-to-many nodes [@www-hpx-5].  The dynamic nature of the model
accommodates effective

> "computing resource management and task scheduling".

It is portable and performance-oriented. HPX-5 was
developed by IU Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies
(CREST). Concurrency is provided by lightweight control object (LCO)
synchronization and asynchronous remote procedure calls. ParallelX
component allows for termination detection and supplies per-process
collectives. It

> "addresses the challenges of starvation, latency, overhead,
> waiting, energy and reliability".

Finally, it supports OpenCL to use distributed GPU and
coprocessors. HPX-5 could be compiled on various OS platforms, however
it was only tested on several Linux and Darwin (10.11)
platforms. Required configurations and environments could be accessed
via [@www-hpx-5-user-guide].
