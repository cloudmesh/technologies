AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queueing Protocol. It is an open
standard source. It allows development of applications and work as
middleware to broker messages between different processes,
applications, or systems that need to talk to each other and pass on
messages. It creates interoperability between clients and brokers. The
protocol is binary, with features like negotiation, multichannel,
portability, efficiency and asynchronous messaging.

It is commonly split into the below layers, namely, a functional layer
and a transport layer.

* Functional layer - Defines the commands for functioning on the part of the application
* Physical Layer - forms the physical (i.e. hardware) base for OSI to work.
* Data Link Layer - transfers the data between network nodes.
* Network Layer - directs the traffic (i.e. forwarding) between places.
* Transport Layer - Carry different techniques such as framing, channel multiplexing, data representation, etc., between the server and the application.
* Session Layer - responsible of managing the session between applications.
* Presentation (Syntax) Layer - working to shape and present the data to be processed.
* Application Layer - setting and ensuring common grounds - reaching the applications - for communication. (This is where AMQP lives!)

### Advantages 

* Rapid and guaranteed message deliveries
* Reliability and message acknowledgments
* Globally share and monitor updates and also to enable communication between different systems that are connected
* Full synchronous functionality for systems as well as improved reliability

In AMQP, *message brokers* translate to applications which receive the
actual messages and route (i.e. transfer) them to relevant
parties.[2]. After receiving the message from the client, the exchange
process them and route them to the queue. Following are types of
exchanges:

#### Direct Exchange

Direct exchange type involves the delivery of messages to queues based
on routing keys. Routing keys can be considered as additional data
defined to set where a message will go. Typical use case for direct
exchange is load balancing tasks in a round-robin way between workers.


#### Fanout Exchange

Fanout exchange completely ignores the routing key and sends any
message to all the queues bound to it.

Use cases for fanout exchanges usually involve distribution of a
message to multiple clients for purposes similar to notifications:

Sharing of messages (e.g. chat servers) and updates (e.g. news)
Application states (e.g. configurations)

#### Topic Exchange

Topic exchange is mainly used for pub/sub (publish-subscribe)
patterns. Using this type of transferring, a routing key alongside
binding of queues to exchanges are used to match and send messages.

Whenever a specialized involvement of a consumer is necessary (such as
a single working set to perform a certain type of actions), topic
exchange comes in handy to distribute messages accordingly based on
keys and patterns.

#### Headers Exchange

Headers exchange constitutes of using additional headers (i.e. message
attributes) coupled with messages instead of depending on routing keys
for routing to queues.

Being able to use types of data other than strings (which are what
routing keys are), headers exchange allow differing routing mechanism
with more possibilities but similar to direct exchange through keys.
