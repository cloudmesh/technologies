CoreOS allows applications to run on
containers. CoreOS can be run on clouds, virtual or physical
servers. CoreOS allows the ability for automatic software updates
inorder to make sure containers in cluster are secure and reliable. It
also makes managing large cluster environments easier. CoreOS provides
open source tools like CoreOS Linux, etcd,rkt and flannel. CoreOS also
has commercial products Kubernetes and CoreOS stack. In CoreOS linux
service discovery is achieved by etcd, applications are run on Docker
and process management is achieved by fleet.
