A Graph Database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic
queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data
 [@www-graphdb]. The Graph is a concept which directly relates the
data items in the store.  The data which is present in the store is
linked together directly with the help of relationships. It can be
retrieved with a single operation.  Graph database allow simple and
rapid retrieval of complex hierarchical structures that are difficult
to model in relational systems.

There are different underlying storage mechanisms used by graph
databases.  Some graphdb depend on a relational engine and store the
graph data in a table, while others use a key-value store or
document-oriented database for storage. Thus, they are inherently
caled as NoSQL structures.  Data retrieval in a graph database
requires a different query language other than SQL. Some of the query
languages used to retrieve data from a graph database are Gremlin,
SPARQL, and Cypher.  Graph databases are based on graph theory. They
employ the concepts of nodes, edges and properties.
