General Parallel File System (GPFS) was rebranded as IBM Spectrum
Scale on February 17, 2015 [@www-wikigpfs].

Spectrum Scale is a clustered file system, developed by IBM, designed
for high performance. It

> "provides concurrent high-speed file access to applications
> executing on multiple nodes of clusters"

and can be
deployed in either shared-nothing or shared disk
modes [@www-wikigpfs].  Spectrum Scale is available on AIX, Linux,
Windows Server, and IBM System Cluster 1350 [@www-wikigpfs].  Due
to its focus on performance and scalability, Spectrum Scale has been
utilized in compute clusters, big data and analytics - including
support for Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), backups and
restores, and private clouds [@www-spectrumscale].
