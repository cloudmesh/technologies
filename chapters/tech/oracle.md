Oracle Database [@fa18-423-06-www-Oracle-DB] is a "relational database
management system from the Oracle Corporation." The software was originally
developed by famous billionaire and founder of Oracle, Lawrence Ellington and
other developers in 1977 [@fa18-423-06-www-Oracle-Defintion]. Oracle DB is a
very popular database software that is very scalable and can be used across a
wide variety of networks. That is one of the main reasons that Oracle DB is
used by many major companies across the globe.

The power and usability of Oracle DB was seen in the Prime Day fiasco that hit
Amazon in 2018. Amazon, who is developing their own personal database software,
wants to be out of the Oracle DB system before 2020 due to arguments about
pricing [@fa18-423-06-www-Oracle-Amazon]. However, their own software left them
with slowed sales and thousands of delayed packages because of website and
warehouse database errors. Matt Caesar, a computer science professor at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, believes
> "it appears they would have been able to diagnose the problem sooner if they
> were using Oracle's database, which could possibly have reduced the outage
> duration" [@fa18-423-06-www-Oracle-Amazon].

Oracle DB has been used as a reliable and important software for years. The
Amazon Prime Day mistake proves that the software is not only important, but
necessary to the core functions of most large corporations.

You would think that the database market is something that is very much
"set-in-stone," but Oracle has recently announced that they are rolling out an
autonomous, cloud database that is gaining traction. An autonomous database can
continuously tune and upgrade data without downtime
[@fa18-423-06-www-Oracle-Autonomous]. The software is performing tasks
autonomously that Database Managers would normally perform, such as updating the
software, scaling-up data, and applying patches. One example is security
patches. Security patches protect the data that is stored in the database from
outside threats. According to Forbes, the number one cause of data breaches in
companies is a system that lacks up-to-date securities patches
[@fa18-423-06-www-Oracle-Autonomous]. Therefore, the autonomous database not
only automates redundant tasks such as upgrades and scalability, but protects
the data from outside threats, an incredibly important issue in today's world.
