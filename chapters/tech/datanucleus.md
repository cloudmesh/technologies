DataNucleus is an advanced form of the Java Persistent Objects (JPOX) technology. It is an open-source programming software product used for data management in Java[@fa18-523-73-wikipedia2008]. It supports a wide range of datastores and provides persistence to relational, graph-based, map-based, object-based datastores, document-based, and web-based storage. The software is mainly used to persist classed data to the datastore. Persistence is the property of outliving the process that created the system. For instance, after a computer breakdown, the hard-disk remains stored with information that can still be retrieved and used in another computer instead of losing all the info with other programs. The DataNucleus persists the stored values and sets them again when retrieving data from the datastore. This function is made possible by the use of standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Java has two APIs: Java Data Objects (JDO) and Java Persistence API (JPA). The difference between the two is mainly the metadata definitions applied.

The DataNucleus technology is applied by system developers to optimize the user experience of their software. It gives the user control of what he wants to retrieve through a customizable interface. The DataNucleus also enables interface interoperability for users who wish to change their datastores in the future. It has an extension mechanism for its interfaces which can be extended to allow it to perform more functions. An interactive user interface makes the computer programmer comfortable with the system because it can be customized to suit his preferences or those of his client. 

:o: This is not an experience report

Judging from my experience with DataNucleus, I can say that it assists me in persistence mapping of my classes of data using JDO annotations. The technology also helps when a computer breaks down to save and retrieve valuable information by preventing data losses. To summarize, I can say that by choosing DataNucleus you get great benefits in its usage. The process is very quick and easy. And it provides outstanding performance when compared with the competing technologies.
