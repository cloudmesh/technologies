Neptune refers to one of the most effective big data technologies that are known for executing vast and complex technological tasks with remarkable efficiency. 

Nearly every sphere of life is largely dependent on the efficiency of big data technology for solutions that cannot be provided by alternative technological systems. For example, big data technology has often been utilized to improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns by identifying user web clicks, which are used for determining the current shopping trends among the consumers [@Harkness, 2017]. Normally, such a process would require extensive and intensive calculations using vast amounts of data from databases and other sites.

Among the distinguishing merits of this technology is the capacity to handle large volume of data at exceptionally high velocities. Moreover, the advantage of Neptune is that it is designed with the three advantages, namely greater velocity, variety, and simplicity of operation. This means that it is capable of completing difficult tasks a little bit faster in comparison to ordinary systems that will require more time to perform the same.

Using Neptune big data technology is always a rewarding experience because it offers the combined satisfaction of speed and accuracy. 

First time users who are accustomed to the conventional systems will experience a significant difference when using this technological solution because of the faster turnaround of tasks and remarkable efficiency. Working with conventional technologies is usually stressful because it makes it difficult to complete the assigned tasks within the set deadlines. One of the defining strengths of this technology is that it functions with greater levels of output, which means that the user can accomplish multiple varieties of tasks without strenuous thinking or physical efforts. Overall, Neptune has proven to be an outstanding innovation that has truly revolutionized the workplace environment.
