Neptune [:o: again you did not include the missing ref ] is effective big data technologies for executing vast and complex technological tasks with remarkable efficiency.
Nearly every sphere of life is largely dependent on the efficiency of big data technology for solutions that cannot be provided by alternative technological systems. For example, big data technology has often been utilized to improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns by identifying user web clicks, which are used for determining the current shopping trends among the consumers [Harkness, 2017]. Normally, such a process would require extensive and intensive calculations using vast amounts of data from databases and other sites. 


Among the distinguishing merits of this technology is the capacity to handle large volume of data at exceptionally high velocities. Moreover, the advantage of Neptune is that it is designed with the three advantages, namely greater velocity, variety, and simplicity of operation. This means that it is capable of completing difficult tasks a little bit faster in comparison to ordinary systems that will require more time to perform the same.
