Titan [@fa18-523-52-titan] is a graph database that can be optimized for 
storage and query of graphs that can contain hundreds of billions of edges 
and vertices that are spread across multiple machine clusters. This multiple 
machine cluster that can support many concurrent users in real time. Its main 
integration platform is based on Apache and is open sourced. Titan specifically
sits upon the Apache Cassandra database. Titan is a beneficial tool because it
can access storage and other computational methods that normally one machine 
is unable to provide. Titan can be described as a graphical database engine 
that incorporates current solutions into building blocks that form a system 
[@fa18-523-52-architectural].

The primary language that users use to traverse their graphs is Gremlin. 
Gremlin is an Apache query language that provides ease of transport 
through large datasets. Titan is elastic enough to provide the introduction
and removal of different machines. Titan is different from other database
technologies since it does not require the use of master-slave read/write 
orientations. Titan also uses Hadoop for batch graph analysis and processing.
Aside from Apache Cassandra, Titan also uses HBase and BerkeleyDB database
storage systems [@fa18-523-52-titan]. 

Titan holds applications that act in two specific ways. The first is the 
embedding of Titan inside applications provided by the Gremlin language inside
the same Java Virtual Machine. Storage may be remote or local when database 
handling is provided within the same Java Virtual Machine. The second method
is used by interaction with local or remote Titan instances from query 
additions along the same server.
