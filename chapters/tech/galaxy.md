Ansible Galaxy is a website platform and command line tool that
enables users to discover, create, and share community developed
roles. Users' GitHub accounts are used for authentication, allowing
users to import roles to share with the ansible community. A
description of how Ansible roles are encapsulated and reusable tools
for organizing automation content is available
in [@www-galaxy-ansible]. Thus a role contains all tasks,
variables, and handlers that are necessary to complete that
role. Roles are depicted as the most powerful part of Ansible as they
keep playbooks simple and readable [@Ansible-book-2016].

> "They provide reusable definitions that you can include whenever
> you need and customize with any variables that the role exposes."
