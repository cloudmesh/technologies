AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered from Amazon
Web Services which provides user with a platform for easy and quick
deployment of their WebApps and
services [@www-amazon-elastic-beanstalk]. Amazon Elastic BeanStack
automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning
by Amazon Cloud Watch, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-scaling, and
application health monitoring of the WebApps and
service [@amazon-elastic-beanstalk-book]. AWS Management Console
allows the users to configure an automatic scaling mechanism of AWS
Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Load Balancing enables a load balancer,
which automatically spreads the load across all running instances in
an auto-scaling group based on metrics like request count and latency
tracked by Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon CloudWatch tracks and stores
per-instance metrics, including request count and latency, CPU, and
RAM utilization. Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in
Java, PHP, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby as well as supports
different container types for each language such as Apache Tomcat for
Java applications, Apache HTTP Server for PHP applications Docker, GO
and much more for specific languages where the container defines the
infrastructure and software stack to be used for a given
environment.

> Web Services and are designed to provide a stable, secure, and
> high-performance execution environment for Amazon EC2 Cloud
> computing" [@www-amazon-elastic-beanstalk].
