Theano is a Python library. It was written at the LISA lab.  Initially
it was created with the purpose to support efficient development of
machine learning (ML) algorithms.  Theano uses recent GPUs for higher
speed.  It is used to evaluate mathematical expressions and especially
those mathematical expressions that include multi-dimensional arrays.
Theano's working is dependent on combining aspects of a computer
algebra system and an optimizing compiler.  This combination of
computer algebra system with optimized compilation is highly
beneficial for the tasks which involves complicated mathematical
expressions and that need to be evaluated repeatedly as evaluation
speed is highly critical in such cases.  It can also be used to
generate customized C code for number of mathematical operations.  For
cases where many different expressions are there and each of them is
evaluated just once, Theano can minimize the amount of compilation and
analyses overhead [@www-theano].
