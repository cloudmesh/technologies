According to [@www-knox],

> ``the Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with
> Apache Hadoop clusters.''

REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is web
architectural style designed for distributed hypermedia systems and
defines a set of constraints. [@fielding] API Gateways manage concerns
related to


> ``Authentication, Transport Security, Load-balancing, Request
> Dispatching (including fault tolerance and service discovery),
> Dependency Resolution, Transport Transformations.'' [@peyrott]

Although every Apache Hadoop cluster has its own set of REST APIs,
Knox will represent all of them as

> ``a single cluster specific application context path.''

[@www-knox]

Knox protects Apache Hadoop
clusters, by way of its gateway function, by aiding

> ``the control, integration, monitoring and automation of critical
> administrative and analytical needs.'' [@www-knox]

Some Apache Hadoop Services that
integrate with Knox are,

> ``Ambari, WebHDFS (HDFS), Templeton (Hcatalog), Stargate (Hbase),
> Oozie, Hive/JDBC, Yarn RM, [and] Storm.'' [@www-knox]

Apache Knox has a configuration driven method to
aid in the addition of new routing services. [@www-knox] This allows
support for new and custom Apache Hadoop REST APIs to be added to the
Knox gateway quickly and easily. [@www-knox] This technology would be
best placed under the interoperability category.
