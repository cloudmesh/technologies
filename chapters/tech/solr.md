SOLR is an open source search platform used for searching applications. It was built on top of Lucene which is a Java
based full text search engine. SOLR was created by Yonik Seely in 2004 to add search capability to CNET application.
It was then made an open source by Apache software foundation.
SOLR can be used along with Hadoop to deal with large volumes of data. SOLR is not only a search engine but 
also used for storage purpose. It acts as a No-SQL database (Non- releational data storage)
SOLR is scalable and ready to deploy to search and store large volumes of data.
SOLR can be communicated with restful API's. 

Solr enables powerful matching capabilities including phrases,wildcards, joins grouping across any datatype. This feature 
makes it capable for a full text search.
Solr's is designed to adapt to the user needs all while simplifying configuration which makes it easily configurable.
Solr is flexible and extensible. Solr publishes many well-defined extension points that make it easy to plugin both index and also query time plugins. Since it is Apache-licensed open source, you can change any code you want. Solr is a No SQL database that makes it more efficient in handling large volume of data.
Since Solr is built on the battle-tested Apache Zookeeper, Solr makes it easy to scale up and down. Solr bakes in replication, distribution, rebalancing and fault tolerance out of the box. Solr takes advantage of Lucene's Near Real-Time Indexing capabilities to make sure you see your content when you want to see it. Solr publishes loads of metric data which makes monitoring simple.
SOLR is built on top of Lucene. Hence, it inherits all the benefits of Lucene and also provides ready-to-deploy service to
build a search box featuring autocomplete, which Lucene doesn't provide.
