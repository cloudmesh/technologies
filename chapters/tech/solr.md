Technology Summary Solr - Chaitanya Kakarala (F18-523-53):

SOLR is an open source search platform used for searching applications. It was built on top of Lucene which is a Java
based full text search engine. SOLR was created by Yonik Seely in 2004 to add search capability to CNET application.
It was then made an open source by Apache software foundation.
SOLR can be used along with Hadoop to deal with large volumes of data. SOLR is not only a search engine but 
also used for storage purpose. It acts as a No-SQL database (Non- releational data storage)
SOLR is scalable and ready to deploy to search and store large volumes of data.
SOLR can be communicated with restful API's. 

Some key features of SOLR include:
1. Full Text Search
2. Enterprise Ready
3. Flexible and Extensible
4. No SQL Database
5. Highly Scalable
6. Text centric.

Since SOLR is built on top of Lucene, it inherits all the benefits of Lucene and also provides ready-to-deploy service to
build a search box featuring autocomplete, which Lucene doesn't provide.
