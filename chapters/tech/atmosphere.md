Atmosphere or as it was previously known as iPlant Collaborative is a Cloud Computing platform developed by CyVerse with the aim of providing high power computational resources to everyone in the research community to analyze and perform various resource heavy tasks on possible real-world complex datasets and enable cutting edge research and data-driven discovery. The platform also educates people new to Cloud Computing with various tutorials available free. It is being managed by the funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF). It gives the user to create a "Virtual Machine" in the Cloud [@www-at1]. The concept of Virtual Machines (VMs) has become very popular among developers since it gave them the opportunity to work with multiple Operating Systems (OS) on a single machine which was usually their local machine or their personal computer. With the power of Cloud Computing, CyVerse aimed to create such virtual machines (VMs) pre-configured for various domain specific tasks and capable of running data and computationally intensive algorithms in the cloud and make it accessible for the developers or people in the field of research who wanted machines with such capability. To use Atmosphere, the user can use his local machine, since everything is done in the Cloud there are no minimum local machine requirements to use Atmosphere. This service can be accessed from any device and is entirely platform independent. But prior knowledge of a Linux environment or command-line is useful and necessary to a certain extent. The user first needs to register with CyVerse and create an account. The user then needs to request access to Atmosphere to utilize the computer power in the cloud. Atmosphere is built in a way that makes it easy for multiple users or researchers working on a single project easy [@www-at2]. This is done by enabling screen sharing between multiple users, so people can work collaboratively on data analysis. The team responsible has also built a web portal for easy access to the resources in the cloud and continue to keep improving the platform to accommodate the needs of the research community in a timely manner.
