Kibana is an open source data visualization plugin for
Elasticsearch [@www-kibana-1]. It provides visualization
capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch
cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts
and maps on top of large volumes of data [@www-kibana-2]. The
combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (also known as ELK
stack or Elastic stack) is available as products or service. Logstash
provides an input stream to Elastic for storage and search, and Kibana
accesses the data for visualizations such as
dashboards [@www-kibana-3].  Elasticsearch is a search engine
based on Lucene [@www-kibana-4]. It provides a distributed,
multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface
and schema-free JSON documents. Kibana makes it easy to understand
large volumes of data. Its simple, browser-based interface enables you
to quickly create and share dynamic dashboards that display changes to
Elasticsearch queries in real
time [@www-kibana-5] [@www-kibana-6].
