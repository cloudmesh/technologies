A public cloud is a scenario where a provider provides services such
as infrastructure or applications to the public over the
internet. Google cloud generally refers to services such as cloud
print, connect, messaging, storage and platform [@www-google-cloud]. Google
cloud print allows a print-aware application on a device, installed on
a network, to provide prints to any printer on that network. Cloud
connect allows an automatic storage and synchronization of Microsoft
word documents, power-points and excel sheets to Google docs while
preserving the Microsoft office formats. In certain cases, developers
require important notifications to be sent to applications targeting
android operating system. Google cloud messaging provides such
services. Google cloud platform allows the developers to deploy their
mobile, web and backend solutions on a highly scalable and reliable
infrastructure [@goo2]. It gives developers a privilege of using
any programming language. Google cloud platform provides a wide range
of products and services including networking, storage, machine
learning, big data, authentication and security, resource management,
etc. In general, public clouds provide services to different end users
with the usage of the same shared infrastructure [@goo3]. Windows
Azure services platform, Amazon elastic compute cloud and Sun cloud
are few examples of public clouds.
