The mission of InCommon is to

> "create and support a common trust framework for U.S. education and
> research.  This includes trustworthy shared management of access to
> on-line resources in support of education and research in the United
> States." [@www-incommon]

This mission ultimately is a simplification and an elimination of the
need for multiple accounts across various websites that are at risk of
data spills or misuse.  In the academic setting, this helps assist
researchers to focus on their area of study, and enabling the cross
collaboration which is happening on a globa scale.  Currently any two
and four year higher education institution that is accredited is
eligble for joining InCommon.
