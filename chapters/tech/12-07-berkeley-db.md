Berkeley DB is a family of open source, NoSQL key-value database
libraries [@www-bdb-wiki]. It provides a simple function-call API
for data access and management over a number of programming languages,
including C, C++, Java, Perl, Tcl, Python, and PHP. Berkeley DB is
embedded because it links directly into the application and runs in
the same address space as the application [@www-bdb-stanford]. As
a result, no inter-process communication, either over the network or
between processes on the same machine, is required for database
operations. It is also extremely portable and scalable, it can manage
databases up to 256 terabytes in size.
     
For data management, Berkeley DB offers advanced services, such as
concurrency for many users, ACID transactions, and
recovery [@www-bdb].
     
Berkeley DB is used in a wide variety of products and a large number
of projects, including gateways from Cisco, Web applications at
Amazon.com and open-source projects such as Apache and Linux.
