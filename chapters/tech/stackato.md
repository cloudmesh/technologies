Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HPE Helion Stackato is a platform as a
service (PaaS) cloud computing solution.  The platform facilitates
deployment of the user's application in the cloud and will function on
top of an Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) [@www-hpe]. Multiple
cloud development is supported across AWS, vSphere, and Helion
Openstack.  The platform supports the following programming languages:
native .NET support, java, Node.js, python, and ruby.  This
flexibility is advantageous compared to early PaaS solutions which
would force the customer into utilizing a single stack.  Additionally,
this solution has the capacity to support private, public and hybrid
clouds [@www-virt]. This capability user has to not have to make
choices of flexibility over security of sensitive data when choosing a
cloud computing platform.
