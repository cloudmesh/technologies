A real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications is
provided by a open source, data management platform named Pivotal
Gemfire.

> "GemFire pools memory, CPU, network resources, and optionally local
> disk across multiple processes to manage application objects and
> behavior".

The main features of Gemfire are high scalability, continuous
availability, shared nothing disk persistence, heterogeneous data
sharing and parallelized application behavior on data stores to name a
few.  In Gemfire, clients can subscribe to receive notifications to
execute their task based on a specific change in data. This is
achieved through the continuous querying feature which enables
event-driven architecture. The shared nothing architecture of Gemfire
suggests that each node is self-sufficient and independent, which
means that if the disk or caches in one node fail the remaining nodes
remaining untouched. Additionally, the support for multi-site
configurations enable the user to scale horizontally between different
distributed systems spread over a wide geographical network
