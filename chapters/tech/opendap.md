OPeNDAP is an acronym for

> "Open-source Project for a Network Data Access 
> Protocol" [@www-OPeNDAP-wikipedia]. 

The OPeNDAP focused on enhancing the retrieval of remote, structured
 data through a Web-based architecture and a discipline-neutral Data Access
 Protocol (DAP) [@www-OPeNDAP-wikipedia].
It allows users to access data anywhere from the internet using a variety of
 client/server methods, including Ferret. Employing technology similar to that
 used by the World Wide Web, OPeNDAP and Ferret create a powerful tool for the
 retrieval, sampling, analyzing and displaying of datasets; regardless of size
 or data format (though there are data format limitations)
 [@www-OPeNDAP-wikipedia-ferret].
"OPeNDAP" often is used in place of "DAP" to denote the protocol but also
 may refer to an entire DAP-based data-retrieval architecture
 [@www-OPeNDAP-wikipedia]. 

OPeNDAP is a framework that simplifies all aspects of scientific data 
networking.
OPeNDAP provides software which makes local data accessible to remote 
locations regardless of local storage format.
OPeNDAP also provides tools for transforming existing applications into
 OPeNDAP clients (i.e., enabling them to remotely access OPeNDAP served data).
OPeNDAP software is freely available [@www-opendap-org]. It widely used,
 especially in Earth science, the protocol is layered on HTTP, and its 
 current specification is DAP4, though the previous DAP2 version remains
 broadly used. Developed and advanced (openly and collaboratively) by the
 non-profit OPeNDAP, Inc., DAP is intended to enable remote, selective
 data-retrieval as an easily invoked Web service. OPeNDAP, Inc. also 
 develops and maintains zero-cost (reference) implementations of the 
 DAP protocol in both server-side and client-side software 
 [@www-OPeNDAP-wikipedia].

OPeNDAP provide data services based on cloud computing technology that is 
equivalent to those developed for traditional computing and storage systems 
is critical for successful migration to cloud-based architectures for data
 production, scientific analysis and storage [@www-opendap-org]. 


OPeNDAP Web-service capabilities (comprising the Data Access Protocol (DAP)
 specification plus open-source software for realizing DAP in servers and 
 clients) are among the most widely deployed means for achieving 
 data-as-service functionality in the Earth sciences. OPeNDAP services 
 are especially common in traditional data center environments where servers 
 offer access to datasets stored in (very large) file systems, and a
 preponderance of the source data for these services is being stored in the 
 Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5) [@www-opendap-Comparing].

DODS/OPeNDAP driver implements read-only support for reading feature data from
 OPeNDAP (DODS) servers. It is optionally included in OGR if built with 
 OPeNDAP support libraries.
When opening a database, its name should be specified in the form "DODS:url".
 The URL may include a constraint expression a shown here. Note that it may
 be necessary to quote or otherwise protect DODS URLs on the command line if 
 they include question mark or ampersand characters as these often have special
 meaning to command shells.
By default top level Sequence, Grid and Array objects will be translated into
 corresponding layers. Sequences are (by default) treated as point layers with
 the point geometries picked up from lat and lon variables if available. 
 To provide more sophisticated translation of sequence, grid or array items 
 into features it is necessary to provide additional information to OGR as 
 DAS (dataset auxiliary information) either from the remote server, or locally 
 via the AIS mechanism [@www-gdal-org].
