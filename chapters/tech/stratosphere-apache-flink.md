Apache Flink is an open-source stream processing framework for
distributed, high-performing, always-available, and accurate data
streaming applications. Apache Flink is used in big data application
primarily involving analysis of data stored in Hadoop clusters.  It
also supports a combination of in-memory and disk-based processing as
well as handles both batch and stream processing jobs, with data
streaming the default implementation and batch jobs running as
special-case versions of streaming application [@wikipedia-flink].
