LevelDB is a light-weight, single-purpose library for persistence with
bindings to many platforms [@www-leveldb]. It is a simple open
source on-disk key/value data store built by Google, inspired by
BigTable and is used in Google Chrome and many other products. It
supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular get,
put and delete operations, batched put and delete, bi-directional
iterators and simple compression using the very fast Snappy
algorithm. It is hosted on GitHub under the New BSD License and has
been ported to a variety of Unix-based systems, Mac OS X, Windows, and
Android. It is not an SQL database and does not support SQL
queries. Also, it has no support for indexes. Applications use LevelDB
as a library, as it does not provide a server or command-line
interface.
