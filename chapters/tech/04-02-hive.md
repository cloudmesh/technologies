The reason behind development of Hive is making it easier for end
users to use Hadoop. Map reduce programs were required to be developed
by users for simple to complex tasks. It lacked expressiveness like
query language. So, it was a time consuming and difficult task for end
users to use Hadoop. For solving this problem Hive was built in
January 2007 and open sourced in August2008.  Hive is an open source
data warehousing solution which is built on top of Hadoop. It
structures data into understandable and conventional database terms
like tables, columns, rows and partitions. It supports HiveQL queries
which have structure like SQL queries. HiveQL queries are compiled to
map reduce jobs which are then executed by Hadoop.  Hive also contains
Metastore which includes schemas and statistics which is useful in
query compilation, optimization and data exploration [@www-hive].
