Hyper-V is a native hypervisor which was first released alongside
Windows Server 2008. It is available free of charge for all the
Windows Server and some client operating systems since the
release. Microsoft Hyper-V, is also codenamed as Viridian and formerly
known as Windows Server Virtualization, is a native hypervisor. Xbox
One also include Hyper-V, in which it would launch both Xbox OS and
Windows 10. [@www-hyper-v-wikipedia]

Hyper-V is used to create virtual machines on x86-64 systems which are
running Windows. Windows 8 onwards, Hyper-V supersedes Windows Virtual
PC as the hardware virtualization component of the client editions of
Windows NT. A server computer running Hyper-V can be configured to
expose individual virtual machines to one or more networks.
