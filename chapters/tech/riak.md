Riak is a set of scalable distributed NoSQL databases developed by
Basho Technologies. Riak KV is a key-value database with time-to-live
feature so that older data is deleted
automatically [@www-riak-kv].  It can be queried through secondary
indexes, search via Apache Solr, and MapReduce. Riak TS is designed
for time-series data. It co- locates related data on the same physical
cluster for faster access [@www-riak-ts]. Riak S2 is designed to
store large objects like media files and software
binaries [@www-riak-s2]. The databases are available in both open
source and commercial versions with multicluster replication provided
only in later. REST APIs are available for these databases.
