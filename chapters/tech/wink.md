Apache wink [@www-apache-wink] provides a framework to develop and
use RESTful web services. It implements using JAX-RS v1.1
specification. The project provides server module which integrates
with all popular web servers and a client module which can used to
write RESTful web services. This project will be integrated with
Geronimo and other opensource REST projects to build a vendor neutral
community. Currently IBM and HP have taken lead. IBM is writing a full
JAX-RS implementation while HP is working on RESTful SDK for client
and server components.  Portion of initial project was also taken from
Apache CXF which uses other Apache components like commons-codec,
commons-logging, Apache-Abdera. Apache wink will simply web services
