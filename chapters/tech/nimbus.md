Cloud computing has 3 models; IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. IaaS model is 
chosen when one wants access to technologies and resources like 
traditional data centers without needing investment in planning,
actual maintenance and management of them. In IaaS model, vendor
is responsible for providing data storage, servers, processing 
power and virtualization while user is responsible for data that
they want to handle, applications that provide interaction with 
data and cloud servers etc. This way users can build virtual data
centers. Nimbus is one such private open source could computing IaaS
platform. Nimbus has solutions geared towards needs of services to 
scientific community [@fa18-523-65-nimbus-1]. 

Nimbus has two platforms, Nimbus Platform and Nimbus Infrastructure. 
Nimbus Platform provides set of tools that provide IaaS' scalability
and flexibility. Nimbus Infrastructure provides IaaS features that are
useful for scientific community. This allows users to utilize virtual
machines on available resources to design an infrastructure they want 
for their purpose. For scientificcommunity, the computations they need
to perform are time consuming and complex and need the job divided on 
cloud to get it done within desired time. However, when they don't have
control over architecture of cloud model, their job can get scheduled 
and be in line without knowing when the task will be done. Nimbus allows
user to create multiple virtual machines to be deployed throughout
cloud to spread the workload. User can also configure these virtual 
machines so that they work in tandem and complete their individual 
tasks to get whole task done in most time and resource efficient manner.
This way users have control over how and when their computational tasks
are completed [@fa18-523-65-nimbus-1].

Nimbus provides speed by providing readymade execution templates and 
running efficient tasks in C++ [@fa18-523-65-nimbus-2]. One of many 
famous use cases for Nimbus is STAR nuclear physics experiment. Nimbus 
was used to perform complex and otherwise time-consuming computations 
by using virtual machines across cloud [@fa18-523-65-nimbus-3].
