Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to
drive processes described in build files as targets and extension
points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the
build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks
allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can
also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance
C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to pilot any
type of process which can be described in terms of targets and
tasks. Ant is written in Java. Users of Ant can develop their own


> "antlibs containing Ant tasks and types, and are offered a large
> number of ready-made commercial or open-source *antlibs*. Ant is
> extremely flexible and does not impose coding conventions or
> directory layouts to the Java projects which adopt it as a build
> tool. Software development projects looking for a solution combining
> build tool and dependency management can use Ant in combination with
> Apache Ivy. The Apache Ant project is part of the Apache Software
> Foundation [@ant-www].
