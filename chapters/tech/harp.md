Harp is a simple, easy to maintain, low risk and easy to scale static
web server that also serves Jade, Markdown, EJS, Less, Stylus, Sass,
and CoffeeScript as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any
configuration and requires low cognitive overhead [@www-harp]. It
supports the beloved layout/partial paradigm and it has flexible
metadata and global objects for traversing the file system and
injecting custom data into templates. It acts like a lightweight web
server that was powerful enough for me to abandon web frameworks for
dead simple front-end publishing. Harp can also compile your project
down to static assets for hosting behind any valid HTTP server.
