BlueMix was IBM's main cloud software prior to its merger with IBMâ€™s Cloud brand. Due to this fact, I decided to write this summary on IBM Cloud because it is easier to find better information on this topic, compared to IBM BlueMix. IBM BlueMix was a cloud computing service that is used as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) [@fa18-423-06-IBM-Cloud]. According to NetworkWorld, 

> "PaaS is a set of services aimed at developers that helps them develop and test apps without 
> having to worry about the underlying infrastructure" [@fa18-423-06-PaaS-Defintion]. 

Therefore, the platform is set up to help developers develop their software without having to completely launch the product and make changes from there. This helps developers minimize errors and be completely ready for launching the product to the market.

With the rebrand to IBM Cloud, they now offer Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). With the SaaS addition, developers are able to create their own Blockchain on the cloud, while adding peers to join and edit as well [@fa18-423-www-Blockchain-BlueMix]. This represents the scalability and adaptability of the software, making it important to future developers. With the IaaS addition, users can use services such as compute power, storage, and networking through the cloud [@fa18-423-06-IBM-Cloud]. The IaaS offers a way to store and communicate data cheaper and faster than ever before. The wide variety of services offered through IBM Cloud has made it very successful in the cloud services industry.

Giant corporations are using IBM Cloud to adapt their operations systems to cut costs and errors to create an efficient supply chain. One example is Walmart, who is partnering with Microsoft's Azure and the IBM Cloud to build their Blockchain and Internet of Things components [@fa18-423-06-www-IBM-Walmart]. IBM Cloud can be used by small developers and giant corporations alike, demonstrating impressive scalability. This is one of the reasons that IBM Cloud has been so successful and a main competitor in the cloud services industry.
