*Retired technology*

BlueMix [@fa18-423-06-www-IBM-Bluemix] was IBM's main cloud software prior to
its merger with IBM's Cloud brand. Due to this fact, I decided to write this
summary on IBM Cloud because it is easier to find better information on this
topic, compared to IBM BlueMix. IBM BlueMix was a cloud computing service that
was used as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) [@fa18-423-06-www-IBM-Cloud].
According to NetworkWorld, PaaS is used by developers to develop and fix errors
without messing with the infrastructure [@fa18-423-06-www-PaaS-Defintion].
Therefore, the platform is set up to help developers develop their software
without having to completely launch the product and make changes after while the
users are already exposed to the software. This helps developers minimize errors
and make themselves as ready as possible for launching the product to the
market.

With the rebrand to IBM Cloud, they now offer Software as a Service (SaaS) and
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). With the SaaS addition, developers are able
to create their own Blockchain on the cloud, while adding peers to join and edit
as well [@fa18-423-06-www-Blockchain-BlueMix]. The SaaS addition provides a
unique opportunity to developers to create software together through a smooth
interface. Since Blockchain is becoming more and more popular, the addition of
Blockchain adaptability is important for developers to continue to use IBM Cloud
as their *go-to* code-writing platform.

With the IaaS addition, users can use services such as compute power, storage,
and networking through the cloud [@fa18-423-06-www-IBM-Cloud]. The IaaS offers a
way to store and communicate data cheaper and faster than ever before. The wide
variety of services offered through IBM Cloud has made it very successful in the
cloud services industry.

Corporations are using IBM Cloud to adapt their operations systems to cut costs
and errors to create an efficient supply chain. One example is Walmart, who is
partnering with Microsoft's Azure and the IBM Cloud to build their Blockchain
and Internet of Things components [@fa18-423-06-www-IBM-Walmart]. IBM Cloud can
be used by small developers and giant corporations alike, demonstrating
impressive scalability. This is one of the reasons that IBM Cloud has been so
successful and a main competitor in the cloud services industry.
