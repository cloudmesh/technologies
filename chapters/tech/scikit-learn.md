Scikit-learn is an open source library that provides simple and
efficient tools for data analysis and data mining. It is accessible to
everybody and reusable in various contexts. It is built on numpy,
Scipy and matplotlib and is commercially usable as it is distributed
under many linux distributions [@book-scikit-learn]. Through a consistent
interface, scikit-learn provides a wide range of learning
algorithms. Scikits are the names given to the modules for SciPy, a
fundamental library for scientific computing and as these modules
provide different learning algorithms, the library is named as
sciki-learn [@wiki-scikit-learn]. It provides an in-depth focus on code
quality, performance, collaboration and documentation. Most popular
models provided by scikit-learn include clustering, cross-validation,
dimensionality reduction, parameter tuning, feature selection and
extraction.
