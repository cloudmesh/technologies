S4 is a distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that
allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing
continuous unbounded streams of data [@www-s4]. It is built on
similar concept of key-value pairs like the MapReduce. The core
platform is written in Java [@www-s4-overview]. S4 provides a
runtime distributed platform that handles communication, scheduling
and distribution across containers. The containers are called S4
nodes. The data is executed and processed on these S4 nodes. These S4
nodes are then deployed on S4 clusters. The user develops applications
and deploys them on S4 clusters for its processing. The applications
are built as a graph of Processing Elements (PEs) and Stream that
interconnects the PEs. All PEs communicate asynchronously by sending
events on streams. Events are dispatched to nodes according to their
key in the program [@www-s4]. All nodes are symmetric with no
centralized service and no single point of failure. Additionally there
is no limit on the number of nodes that can be
supported. [@www-wiki-s4]. In S4, both the platform and the
applications are built by dependency injection, and configured through
independent modules.
