ERROR WRONG EMPHASIZE USED

ZeroMQ is introduced as a software product that can

> ``connect your code in any language, on any platform''

by leveraging

> ``smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull, and router-dealer''

to carry

> ``messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, [and] multicast'' [@www-zeromq].

It
is explained that ZeroMQ's

``asynchronous I/O model'' causes this ``tiny library'' to be ``fast
enough to be the fabric for clustered products'' [@www-zeromq2].
It is made clear that ZeroMQ is ``backed by a large and open source
community'' with ``full commercial support'' [@www-zeromq].  In
contrast to Message Passing Interface (i.e. MPI), which is popular
among parallel scientific applications, ZeroMQ is designed as a
fault tolerant method to communicate across highly distributed
systems.
