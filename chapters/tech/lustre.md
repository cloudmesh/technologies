supports many requirements of leadership class HPC simulation
environments and Enterprise environments
worldwide [@www-lustre]. Because Lustre file systems have high
performance capabilities and open licensing, it is often used in
supercomputers.Lustre file systems are scalable and can be part of
multiple computer clusters with tens of thousands of client nodes,
tens of petabytes of storage on hundreds of servers, and more than a
terabyte per second of aggregate I/O throughput. Lustre file systems a
popular choice for businesses with large data centers, including those
in industries such as meteorology, simulation, oil and gas, life
science, rich media, and finance. Lustre provides a POSIX compliant
interface and many of the largest and most powerful supercomputers on
Earth today are powered by the Lustre file system.
