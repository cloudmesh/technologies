Triana is an open source problem solving software that comes with
powerful data analysis tools [@www-triana].  Having
been developed at Cardiff University, it has a good and
easy-to-understand User Interface and is typically used for signal,
text and image processing.  Although it has its own set of analysis
tools, it can also easily be integrated with custom tools.  Some of
the already available toolkits include signal-analysis toolkit, an
image-manipulation toolkit, etc.  Besides, it also checks the data
types and reports the usage of any incompatible tools.  It also
reports errors, if any, as well as useful debug messages in order to
resolve them.  It also helps track serious bugs, so that the program
does not crash.  It has two modes of representing the data - a
text-editor window or a graph-display window.  The graph-display
window has the added advantage of being able to zoom in on particular
features.  Triana is specially useful for automating the repetitive
tasks, like finding-and-replacing a character or a string.
