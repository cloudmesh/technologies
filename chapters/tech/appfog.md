AppFog can be decribed as 

> "a platform as a service (PaaS) provider"  [@Wee2013]. 

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a
 third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually
 those needed for application development -- to users over the
 internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own
 infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install
 in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application
 [@www-searchcloudcomputing].

PaaS does not typically replace a business's entire IT
 infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key
 services, such as application hosting or Java development. A PaaS
 provider builds and supplies a resilient and optimized environment on
 which users can install applications and data sets. Users can focus
 on creating and running applications rather than constructing and
 maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services
 [@www-paas-def].

The Centurylink AppFog is a public multi-tenant Platform-as-a-Service
 (PaaS) based on Cloud Foundry, that makes deploying scalable, robust,
 high performing cloud-native apps fast and easy for
 developers. AppFog supports common developer application runtime that
 include Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, Static Websites and
 ASP.NET. Integrating 3rdParty Add-ons such as database, messaging,
 load balancing, monitoring and more are easily provisioned through
 the AppFog Marketplace[@www-centurylink].

AppFog is a Platform as a Service that can be integrated on-premise
into a company's data center. It is also available as a public
service. The company was originally founded as PHPFog before changing
its name early in 2011 after receiving $8 million in funding.  The
company began focusing more on a private PaaS strategy. AppFog
competes in a crowded market that includes Pivotal's
 Cloud Foundry, Red Hat's OpenShift, ActiveState's Stackato and Apprenda.  
 Heroku and Engine Yard are two of the leaders in the public PaaS market
 [@www-techcrunch].

Cloudfoundry.org pushed the boundaries of platform-as-a-service by
providing an open source tool set that developer could use. From
developer point of view, AppFog has many infrastructures, lettering
you choose them and give you portability of those infrastructure, as
well as code [@www-OReilly-com].

CenturyLink  has acquired AppFog to strengthen its subsidiary Savvis. 
The acquisition will enhance the Savvis Platform-as-a-Service and the data 
hosting solutions [@www-seekingalpha].

AppFog is simply setup Cloud Foundry CLI (Command Line Interface) to
 target an AppFog region, then push your applications up to AppFog
 within seconds. Accomplished without any operational overhead, so
 developers can focus on applications without operational or
 infrastructure distractions [@www-centurylink].  Incoming HTTP/HTTPS
 request route traffic to an application via platform managed Load
 Balancing clusters, with no configuration required by system
 user. Cloud Foundry application instance provisioning is
 automatically balanced across AppFog regional data centers. All
 application data and configuration parameters are automatically
 synced between the provisioned application instances across data
 centers in a region. Cross data center balancing increases the
 application's availability [@www-centurylink].
