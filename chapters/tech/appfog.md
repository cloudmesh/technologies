AppFog can be decribed as 
> "a platform as a service (PaaS) provider"  [@wee]. 
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party
 provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for 
 application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts 
 the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees 
 users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run
 a new application [@searchcloudcomputing].

PaaS does not typically replace a business's entire IT infrastructure. Instead,
 a business relies on PaaS providers for key services, such as application 
 hosting or Java development. A PaaS provider builds and supplies a resilient
 and optimized environment on which users can install applications and data 
 sets. Users can focus on creating and running applications rather than 
 constructing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services
 [@searchcloudcomputing].

The Centurylink AppFog is a public multi-tenant Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
 based on Cloud Foundry, that makes deploying scalable, robust, high
performing cloud-native apps fast and easy for developers. AppFog supports 
common developer application runtime that include
Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, Static Websites and ASP.NET. Integrating
 3rdParty Add-ons such as database, messaging,
load balancing, monitoring and more are easily provisioned through the AppFog 
Marketplace[@centurylink].

AppFog is a Platform as a Service that can be integrated on-premise into a 
company’s data center. It is also available as a public service. The company 
was originally founded as PHPFog before changing its name early in 2011 after
 receiving $8 million in funding.  The company began focusing more on a private
 PaaS strategy. AppFog competes in a crowded market that includes Pivotal’s 
 Cloud Foundry, Red Hat’s OpenShift, ActiveState’s Stackato and Apprenda.  
 Heroku and Engine Yard are two of the leaders in the public PaaS market
 [@techcrunch].

Cloudfoundry.org pushed the boundaries of platform-as-a-service by providing 
an open source tool set that developer could use. From developer point of view,
AppFog has many infrastructures, lettering you choose them and give you 
portability of those infrastructure, as well as code [@www-OReilly-com].

CenturyLink  has acquired AppFog to strengthen its subsidiary Savvis. 
The acquisition will enhance the Savvis Platform-as-a-Service and the data 
hosting solutions [@seekingalpha].

AppFog is simply setup Cloud Foundry CLI (Command Line Interface) to target an
 AppFog region, then push your applications up to AppFog within
seconds. Accomplished without any operational overhead, so developers can focus
 on applications without operational or infrastructure
distractions [@centurylink].
Incoming HTTP/HTTPS request route traffic to an application via platform 
managed Load Balancing clusters, with no configuration
required by system user. Cloud Foundry application instance provisioning 
is automatically balanced across AppFog regional data centers. All application
 data and
configuration parameters are automatically synced between the provisioned 
application instances across data centers in a region. Cross
data center balancing increases the application’s availability [@centurylink].
