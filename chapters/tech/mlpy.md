mlpy is an open source python library made for providing machine
learning functionality. It is built on top of popular existing python
libraries of NumPy, SciPy and GNU scientific libraries (GSL). It also
makes extensive use of Cython language. These form the prerequisites
for mlpy. [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1202-6548] explains the
significance of its components: NumPy, SciPy provide sophisticated
N-dimensional arrays, linear algebra functionality and a variety of
learning methods, GSL, which is written in C, provides complex
numerical calculation functionality.

mlpy provides a wide range of machine learning methods for both
supervised and unsupervised learning problems. mlpy is multiplatform
and works both on Python 2 and 3 and is distributed under GPL3. Mlpy
provides both classic and new learning algorithms for classification,
regression and dimensionality reduction. A detailed list of
functionality is offered by mlpy [@www-mlpy]. Though developed for
general machine learning applications, mlpy has special applications
in computational biology, particularly in functional genomics
modeling.
