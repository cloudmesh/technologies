Handling large amount of data quickly is a challenge many companies 
face. Kafka allows companies to do exactly this. Kafka allows 
distributed streaming of data input and reading from servers. Kafka 
architecture involves producers that send message to broker i.e. 
Kafka server. This data is sent in basic units called messages which
is like sending each row from given dataset. Consumers are applications
that read data from Kafka servers (brokers). Way Kafka proves efficient
is in its ability to handle data fast in real time, compatibility with 
various languages, scalability, retention abilities among many others.
Kafka achieves its fast pace in terms of handling data by breaking the 
data in smaller sets called partitions. A partition as name suggests is
piece of data stored on a machine. Another layer of sophistication that
Kafka brings in while handling data is splitting data by topics. This 
helps when trying to read data from servers. If a consumer wants to read
data on certain topic, he needs to know topic, partition and message 
number (called offset in Kafka architecture). A Kafka server (broker)
can have multiple producers sending data to it simultaneously. At same 
time there might be multiple consumers trying to read data from Kafka 
server. Consumers read the data and either store it on data centers or 
allow application to perform real time analytics with it. Consumers can 
be made efficient by creating multiple consumers that read certain 
numbers of partitions on given topic. Server itself can be made efficient
by dividing the work among cluster of machines. This distributed 
architecture allows to scale Kafka to handle any size of data. Kafkaâ€™s 
ability to support various languages allows one to create applications 
as per their expertise. Kafka also helps by giving ability to store data
either by date, size or type per users need. Kafka is used by Apple Inc., 
Netflix, PayPal, Walmart, Uber among many others. [@fa18-523-65-kafka-1]
