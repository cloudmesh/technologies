Apache Kafka is a streaming platform, which works based on
publish-subscribe messaging system and supports distributed
environment.
      
*Kafka lets you publish and subscribe to the messages.*  Kafka
maintains message feeds based on 'topic'. A topic is a category or
feed name to which records are published. Kafka's Connector APIs are
used to publish the messages to one or more topics, whereas, Consumer
APIs are used to subscribe to the topics.

*Kafka lets you process the stream of data at real time.*
Kafka's stream processor takes continual stream of data from input
topics, processes the data in real time and produces streams of data
to output topics. Kafka's Streams API are used for data
transformation.

*Kafka lets you store the stream of data in distributed
clusters.* Kafka acts as a storage system for incoming data stream. As
Kafka is a distributed system, data streams are partitioned and
replicated across nodes.

Thus, a combination of messaging, storage and processing data stream
makes Kafka a *streaming platform*. It can be used for building data
pipelines where data is transferred between systems or
applications. Kafka can also be used by applications that transform
real time incoming data [@www-kafka].
