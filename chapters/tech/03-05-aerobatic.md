Aerobatic is a platform that allows hosting static
websites\cite{www-aero}. It used to be an ad-on for Bitbucket but now
Aerobatic is transitioning to standalone CLI (command Line Tool) and
web dashboard. Aerobatic allows automatic builds to different
branches. New changes to websites can be deployed using aero deploy
command which can be executed from local desktop or any of CD tools
and services like Jenkins, Codeship,Travis and so on.  It also allows
users to configure custom error pages and offers authentication which
can also be customized. Aerobatic is backed by AWS cloud. Aerobatic
has free plan and pro plan options for customers.
