Google Cloud SQL [@www-cloud-sql-google] or Cloud SQL is the database solution for developers looking to use a completely functional relational database in the cloud that is a part of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It is primarily being offered as a database that requires little management which is considered a big step forward as relational databases usually require a lot of attention from the administrators of the database. This helps the developers to focus on their business rather than spend more time managing the database. At the time of its launch Cloud SQL only came with the option of using MySQL [@www-mysql] but now developers have the option of choosing between a MySQL instance or a PostgreSQL [@www-postgresql-wiki] instance and use Cloud SQL with it. There are a number of pricing options available for the developers to choose from for their application or business. These plans consist of various charges and vary depending on the relational database instance you choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL [@www-cloud-sql-google-faq]. These charges can be paid per hour or per month. Regardless of which database instance you select for your business needs these are the common pricing charges that apply and there are some pricing charges which are database instance specific, the common pricing charges are as follows:

1. Instance Pricing: This charge depends on the machine you require, the amount of CPU power, RAM and storage capacity can be configured for these machines. The price is lower for a smaller machine and increases as you customize your machine. The charge is billed from the minute the machine is up and running.
2. Storage Pricing: This charge consists of the type of storage you choose for your machine; flash storage is more expensive when compared to the normal hard drive storage.
3. Network Pricing: The above-mentioned instance and storage charges also vary from region to region, if your machine is not in the same region, example: Inter-Continental then additional fee is applied.
