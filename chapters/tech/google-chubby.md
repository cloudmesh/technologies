Google Chubby is used as a lock service for a large number of small computing 
machines connected over a network. The main purpose of this lock service is to 
elect the primary among all the peers in a distributed system. Before Chubby, adhoc processes
were used at google for the locking purpose which caused lot of manual intervention in case of any concerns. 
Chubby cells are created with all the servers connected in a distributed sytem and the applications
will elect the server in a chuuby cell as the Master via RPC. Chubby cells are further sub-divided as replicas and 
for the application to elect a server as Master should obtain majority of votes from these replicas. The replicas will
hold on to thier vote for a particular period of time. The usage of Google Chubby at Google helped the developers 
obtain the high availability of resourses. Through-put and storage capacity were considered only after reliability and easily implementing capabilities in Google Chubby's design. It also helped to remove the handles on the servers that has mistakes 
with simple RPC commands.

Google Chubby combats asynchronous consensus which is solved by the Paxos protocol. The implementation in Chubby is based on 
coarse grained lock server and a library that the client applications link against.  As per the 2016 paper [@chubby-paper-2016], an 
open-source implementation of the Google Chubby lock service was provided by the Apache ZooKeeper project. 
ZooKeeper used a Paxos-variant protocol Zab for solving the distributed consensus problem.  
Google stack and Facebook stack both use versions of zookeeper.
