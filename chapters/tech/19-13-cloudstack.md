Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and
manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available,
highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing
platform. It uses existing hypervisors such as KVM, VMware vSphere,
and XenServer/XCP for virtualization. In addition to its own API,
CloudStack also supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) API and the
Open Cloud Computing Interface from the Open Grid
Forum. [@www-cloudstack]

AJAX web GUI for management, AWS API compatibility, Hypervisor
