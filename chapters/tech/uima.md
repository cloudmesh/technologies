Unstructured Information Management applications (UIMA) provides a
framework for content analytics. It searches unstructured data to
retrieve specific targets for the user. For example, when a text
document is given as input to the system, it identifies targets such
as persons, places, objects and even associations. The UIMA
architecture can be thought of as four dimensions: 1. Specifies
component interfaces in analytics pipeline.  2. Describes a set of
Design patterns. 3. Suggests two data representations: an in-memory
representation of annotations for high-performance analytics and an
XML representation of annotations for integration with remote web
services. 4. Suggests development roles allowing tools to be used by
users with diverse skills [@www-wiki-uima].

UIMA uses different, possibly mixed, approaches which include Natural
Language Processing, Machine Learning, IR. UIMA supports multimodal
analytics which enables the system to process the resource fro various
points of view. UIMA is used in several software projects such as the
IBM Research's Watson uses UIMA for analyzing unstructured data and
Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (Apache cTAKES)
which is a UIMA-based system for information extraction from medical
records [@www-uima-slideshare].
