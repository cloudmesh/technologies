DAAL stands for Data Analytics Acceleration Library. DAAL is software
library offered by Intel which is written in C++, python, and Java
which implements algorithm for doing efficient and optimized data
analysis tasks to solve big-data problems [@www-daal-wiki]. The
library is designed to use data platforms like Hadoop, Spark, R, and
Matlab.The important algorithms which DAAL implements are 'Lower Order
Moments' which is used to find out max, min standard deviation of a
dataset, 'Clustering' which is used to do unsupervised learning by
grouping data into unlabelled group. It also include 10-12 other
important algorithms.

DAAL supports three processing modes namely batch processing, online
processing and distributed processing [@www-daal-official].Intel
DAAL addresses all stages of data analytics pipeline namely
pre-processing, transformation, analysis, modelling,validation, and
decision making.
