It is basically a framework for management of a system where the
systems undergo an organized coordination resulting in an automated
deployment of systems which creates an orderly workflow or a parallel
wise job execution. It doesn't rely on central inventories such as SSH
and uses tools such as Middleware [@www-marionette-webpage]. This
gives an advantage of delivering a very scalable and quick execution
environment.  Mcollective gives us a huge advantage of working with a
large number of servers, it uses publish/subscribe middleware for
communicating with many hosts at once in a parallel
manner. Mcollective allows us to interact with a cluster of servers at
the same time, it allows us to use a simple command line to call
remote agents and there isn't a centralized inventory. Mcollective
uses a broadcast paradigm to distribute the requests, where all the
servers receives the request at the same time which are also attached
with a filter. The servers which match the filter will act on these
requests.
