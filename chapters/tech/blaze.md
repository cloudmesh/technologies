### Old text


Blaze library translates NumPy/Pandas-like syntax to data computing
systems (e.g. database, in-memory, distributed-computing). This
provides Python users with a familiar interface to query data in a
variety of other data storage systems.  One Blaze query can work
across data ranging from a CSV file to a distributed database.

Blaze presents a pleasant and familiar interface regardless of what
computational solution or database we use (e.g. Spark, Impala, SQL
databases, No-SQL data-stores, raw-files). It mediates the users
interaction with files, data structures, and databases, optimizing and
translating the query as appropriate to provide a smooth and
interactive session. It allows the data scientists and analyst to
write their queries in a unified way that does not have to change
because the data is stored in another format or a different
data-store. [@www-blaze]

### New text

Blaze is a series of tools which are designed to make the operation of data more
convenient for users.   

> "The Blaze ecosystem is a set of libraries that help users to store,
>describe, query and process data" [@fa18-523-85-blaze].

It is designed for Python users, with an ecosystem to allow Python users process
to large-scale computation, as we know, computation of huge amount data is not
easy to finish efficient, but Blaze can use its library to help Python user to
do that, the ecosystem could be very useful when doing the computation.

To help Python users speed up the computation of large-scale data, the ecosystem
could make the computation simpler than before. Since Blaze provides a unique
language, data shape, that could describe data, and it is out of the data
processing. And there is also a common interface to request data, which is also
out of the data processing. And a uniform utility library to transfer data,
which is called odo. The desk is a parallel computational engine.

But Blaze has nothing to do with the computation, the number operation is also
conducted in other systems. Traditional SQL, or new technology Spark, or the
Pandas package in Python. But for Blaze, it does not use the calculate packages
in Python, nor interacting with libraries.

Blaze is good at operating a little part of data which belongs to an larger
dataset, although the volume maybe be small, but due to its small-scale, the
process speed could be very quick so Blaze could be powerful when dealing with
the data.

All in all, Blaze is a high-level user interface for all Python users who are
interesting in operating dataset and conduct the computation. There is a
symbolic expression system for the requests of data and make it clear to the
database, there is also a translator for the requests for many different
databases. It could be very useful when conducting a multi-platform project.

Due to the special structure of Blaze, it could allow a piece of code to run
well in many different backends, which could be very convenient for developers.
And if Blaze could be applied widely, Python users with different computing
tools could work together with less pressure.
