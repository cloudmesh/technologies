### Old text


Blaze library translates NumPy/Pandas-like syntax to data computing
systems (e.g. database, in-memory, distributed-computing). This
provides Python users with a familiar interface to query data in a
variety of other data storage systems.  One Blaze query can work
across data ranging from a CSV file to a distributed database.

Blaze presents a pleasant and familiar interface regardless of what
computational solution or database we use (e.g. Spark, Impala, SQL
databases, No-SQL data-stores, raw-files). It mediates the users
interaction with files, data structures, and databases, optimizing and
translating the query as appropriate to provide a smooth and
interactive session. It allows the data scientists and analyst to
write their queries in a unified way that does not have to change
because the data is stored in another format or a different
data-store. [@www-blaze]

> "The Blaze ecosystem is a set of libraries that help users store,
> describe, query and process data" [@fa18-523-85-blaze].

It is designed for Python users, with an ecosystem to allow Python
users process to large-scale computation, as we know, computation of
huge amount data is not easy to finish efficient, but Blaze can use
its library to help Python user to do that, the ecosystem could be
very useful when doing the computation.

To help Python users speed up the computation of large scale data, the
ecosystem could make the computation simpler than before. Since Blaze
provide a unique language, datashape, that could describe data, and it
is out of the data processing. And there is also a common interface to
request data, which is also out of the data processing. And a uniform
utility library to transfer data, which is called odo. The desk is a
parallel computational engine.

But Blaze have nothing to do with the computation, the number
operation is also conducted in other systems. Traditional SQL, or new
technology Spark, or the Pandas package in Python. But for Blaze, it
does not use the calculate packages in Python, nor interacting with
libraries.

Blaze is good at operate a little part of data which belongs to a
larger dataset, although the volume maybe be small, but due to its
small scale, the process speed could be very quick so Blaze could be
powerful when dealing with the data.

All in all, Blaze is high-level user interface for all Python users
who are interesting in operating dataset and conduct the computation.
There is a symbolic expression system for the requests of data and
make it clear to the database, there is also a translator for the
requests for many different databases. It could be very useful when
conducting multi-platform project.

Due to the special structure of Blaze, it could allow a piece of code
run well in many different backends, which could be very convenient
for developers. And if Blaze could be applied widely, Python users
with different computing tools could work together with less pressure.
