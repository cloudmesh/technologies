The parasol laboratory is a multidisciplinary research program founded
at Texas A\&M University with a focus on next generation computing
languages.  The core focus is centered around algorithm and
application development to find solutions to data concentrated
problems [@www-parasol]. The developed applications are being
applied in the following areas: computational biology, geophysics,
neuroscience, physics, robotics, virtual reality and computer aided
drug design (CAD).  The program has organized a number of workshops
and conferences in the areas such as software, intelligent systems,
and parallel architecture.
