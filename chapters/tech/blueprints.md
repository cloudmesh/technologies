In [@www-blueprints], it is explained that

> "IBM Blueprint has been replaced by IBM Blueworks Live."

In [@www-blueworks-live2],
IBM Blueworks Live is described

> "as a cloud-based business process modeller, belonging under the
> set of IBM SmartCloud applications"


that as [@www-blueworks-live] states

> "drives out inefficiencies and improves business operations."

Similarly to
Google Docs, IBM Blueworks Live is

> "designed to help organizations discover and document their
> business processes, business decisions and policies in a
> collaborative manner."

While Google Docs and IBM
Blueworks Live are both simple to use in a collaborative manner,
 [@www-blueworks-live2] explains that IBM Blueworks Live has the


> "capabilities to implement more complex models."
