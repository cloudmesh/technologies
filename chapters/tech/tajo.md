Apache Tajo is a robust big data relational and distributed data warehouse system for Apache Hadoop. [@fa18-523-80-www-tajo-apache]. Apache Tajo was designed to handle ad-hoc queries, online aggregation, and extract-transform-load processing on very large data sets. This system was designed for querying and analyzing data sets. The data-sets that are utilized by Apache Tajo are stored using Hadoops Distributed File System also known as HDFS. On top of this Apache Tajo has its own query engine instead of utilizing the MapReduce framework like other Hadoop systems.

Apache Tajo allows for superior data querying by supporting SQL on Hadoop. This way users can interact with data on Hadoop via easy SQL commands. [@fa18-523-80-www-tutorialspoint-tajo] Apache Tajo provides users with a SQL shell to query the HDFS data sets. Clusters are utilized on this framework to carry out queries. Clusters are made up of a master node and several workers. The master node works to plan and organize the workers to divide each query into small tasks that can accomplished in pieces by each worker. This allows for more flexible and powerful querying ability then what is typically seen on Hadoop via the MapReduce framework. Some of the SQL functions that are available in the Apache Tajo framework are Math functions, DateTime Functions, JSON functions, and string functions [@fa18-523-80-www-tutorialspoint-tajo].

Apache Tajo supports several other data formats including JSON, Text File, Parquet, Sequence File, Protocol Buffer, etc.
