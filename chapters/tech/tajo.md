Apache Tajo is a robust big data relational and distributed data
warehouse system for Apache Hadoop [@fa18-523-80-www-tajo-apache].
Apache Tajo was designed to handle ad-hoc queries, online aggregation,
and extract-transform-load processing on very large data sets. This
system was designed for querying and analyzing data sets. The
data-sets that are utilized by Apache Tajo are stored using Hadoops
Distributed File System also known as HDFS. On top of this Apache Tajo
has its own query engine instead of utilizing the MapReduce framework
like other Hadoop systems.

Apache Tajo allows for superior data querying by supporting SQL on
Hadoop. This way users can interact with data on Hadoop via easy SQL
commands [@fa18-523-80-www-tutorialspoint-tajo]. Apache Tajo provides
users with a SQL shell to query the HDFS data sets. Clusters are
utilized on this framework to carry out queries. Clusters are made up
of a master node and several workers. The master node works to plan
and organize the workers to divide each query into small tasks that
can accomplished in pieces by each worker. This allows for more
flexible and powerful querying ability then what is typically seen on
Hadoop via the MapReduce framework. Some of the SQL functions that are
available in the Apache Tajo framework are Math functions, DateTime
Functions, JSON functions, and string functions
[@fa18-523-80-www-tutorialspoint-tajo].

Apache Tajo supports several other data formats including JSON, Text
File, Parquet, Sequence File, Protocol Buffer, etc. While Apache Tajo
supports several different data formats, it also allows the system to
chare data across different repositories. The goal of this is to allow
for online analytical processing of (OLAP) data. Using this process
allows Apache Tajo to scale up and distribute the load of querying the
data. One of the major features of Apache Tajo is its low latency,
scalability and easy of data flow. The latency, scalability, and
formats that Tajo is able to support is a reason why Tajo is such a
powerful system.
