Original:

LMDB (Lighting memory-mapped Database) is a high performance embedded
transactional database in form of a key-value
store [@www-keyvalue]. LMDB is designed around virtual memory
facilities found in modern operating systems, multi-version
concurrency control (MVCC) and single-level store (SLS) concepts. LMDB
stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, provides a range-based
search capability, supports multiple data items for a single key and
has a special mode for appending records at the end of the database
(MDB\_APPEND) which significantly increases its write performance
compared to other similar databases.

LMDB is not a relational database and strictly uses key-value
store [@www-relationaldb].  Key-value databases allows one write
at a time, the difference that LMDB highlights is that write
transactions do not block readers nor do readers block writes. Also,
it does allow multiple applications on the same system to open and use
the store simultaneously which helps in scaling up
performance [@www-lmdb].

LMDB stands for Lightening Memory-Mapped Database Manager, a small software library created by Howard Chu and developed by Symas. Also, the database can be used on almost all modern operating systems. According to Mr. Chu, the database is a very simple key-value store that uses a B+ tree and is fully transactional [@fa18-423-06-Chu-Devoxx]. LMDB was modeled after the BerkleyDB API, but simplified to cut out unnecessary features. Mr. Chu and his team used BerkleyDB API for many years prior to forming their own software, omitting the BDB features that were found to have no benefit or be problematic [@fa18-423-06-Chu-Devoxx]. LMDB is essentially a simpler version of the BDB that focuses on the important features, as opposed to the complexity, of the BDB.

As per the name, LMDB is a memory-mapped database. Therefore, the data that is summoned from the database is found directly through the mapped memory, minimizing user errors and crashes. One of the key points that Mr. Chu pushes is that the system is crash-proof and will never overwrite live data [@fa18-423-06-www-lmdb.tech]. Therefore, a writer is protected from losing their work during the process of writing the data to the database.

The database uses what Mr. Chu refers to as "concurrency support" to ensure that multi-processes are able to be performed. Only a single writer may have a live transaction at any time. Therefore, writers do not write duplicate or deadlock data. In a presentation at DEVOXX France, Mr. Chu says, 

> "It is a single-writer model, but multiple readers. So, writers don't block readers and readers don't block writers" [@fa18-423-06-Chu-Devoxx].

This is a helpful feature for writers and readers alike because they are able to write without fear of a reader blocking their access to the database while trying to write data onto the database.  Also, readers are able to read the data even when a writer may be using the database.
