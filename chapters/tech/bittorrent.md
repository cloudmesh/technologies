BitTorrent [@www-bittorrent] refers to that method of data transfer which allows large
data files to be broken down into smaller ones for efficient data
sharing. The smaller files with the data can be
downloaded from several sources simultaneously. It is indeed the most
common protocol that enables peer to peer file sharing with ease and
most efficiently.

This technology works by allowing users to create a small file,
referred to as torrent, which contains information about the files
and the computers that manage the distribution of those files. To
download a file, one needs to find and open the torrent created and
start downloading files piece by piece. The peers can also share the
pieces with any other interested party trying to download the same
files. This sharing enhances easy file downloads as more pieces of
data can be found in multiple sources. BitTorrent provides faster
download speeds at a significantly low bandwidth as a result of
breaking down files into smaller pieces.

BitTorrent does not only provides faster download speeds but also solves the problem of high bandwidth needed. In the traditional download mode, the file is generally transferred from the server to the client. Which means more people download, more bandwidth needed. But BitTorrent breaks the file to the small piece, it uses a pyramid scheme to achieve sharing. Which means it's not only one server, every client how has to download the same thing will be the server, no super high bandwidth needed.
