Bittorrent is P2P communication protocol commonly used for sending and
receiving the large digital files like movies and audioclips.In order
to upload and download file, user have to download bittorrent client
which implement the bittorrent protocol. Bittorrent uses the principle
of swarning and tracking [@www-bittorrent]. It divides the files
in large number of chunk and as soon as file is received it can be
server to the other users for downloading.  So rather than downloading
one entire large file from one source, user can download small chunk
from the different sources of linked users in swarn. Bittorrent
trackers keeps list of files available for transfer and helps the
swarn user find each other.

Using the protocol, machine with less configuration can serve as
server for distributing the files. It result in increase in the
downloading speed and reduction in origin server configuration.
