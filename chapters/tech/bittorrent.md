BitTorrent refers to that method of data transfer which allows large data files to be broken down into smaller ones for efficient data sharing [@www-bittorrent]. The smaller files with the data can be downloaded from several sources simultaneously. It is indeed the most common protocol that enables peer to peer file sharing with ease and most efficiently. 

This technology works by allowing users to create a small file, referred to as â€˜torrent', which contains information about the files and the computers that manage the distribution of those files. To download a file, one needs to find and open the torrent created and start downloading files piece by piece. The peers can also share the pieces with any other interested party trying to download the same files. This sharing enhances easy file downloads as more pieces of data can be found in multiple sources. BitTorrent provides faster download speeds at a significantly low bandwidth as a result of breaking down files into smaller pieces.

I do not feel comfortable using BitTorrent mainly due to the security issues associated with them. When downloading files from multiple sources, the computers and the network are at risk of getting infected with viruses, malware, and spyware programs. Another major security concern is the directive on the torrent website to leave the computer running so that files can be shared with other peers. This renders the computer prone to numerous types of cyber-attacks, regardless of whether or not one has anti-virus protection on one's computer. Additionally, I feel uncomfortable with BitTorrent because it does not offer anonymity to my IP address, which means anybody can view my IP address while I am downloading files using the BitTorrent platform. 

Having used BitTorrent extensively and having done an in-depth study about its security systems, I conclude that it is too risky to be used, because the drawbacks in the system far outweigh the benefits.  Though, there have been advancements, such as seed boxes, to promote anonymity and to solve some system irregularities, full and reliable integration with the current technology has not yet been achieved.

Bittorrent is P2P communication protocol commonly used for sending and
receiving the large digital files like movies and audioclips.In order
to upload and download file, user have to download bittorrent client
which implement the bittorrent protocol. Bittorrent uses the principle
of swarning and tracking [@www-bittorrent]. It divides the files
in large number of chunk and as soon as file is received it can be
server to the other users for downloading.  So rather than downloading
one entire large file from one source, user can download small chunk
from the different sources of linked users in swarn. Bittorrent
trackers keeps list of files available for transfer and helps the
swarn user find each other.

Using the protocol, machine with less configuration can serve as
server for distributing the files. It result in increase in the
downloading speed and reduction in origin server configuration.
