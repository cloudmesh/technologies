BitTorrent refers to that method of data transfer which allows large
data files to be broken down into smaller ones for efficient data
sharing [@www-bittorrent]. The smaller files with the data can be
downloaded from several sources simultaneously. It is indeed the most
common protocol that enables peer to peer file sharing with ease and
most efficiently.

This technology works by allowing users to create a small file,
referred to as *torrent*, which contains information about the files
and the computers that manage the distribution of those files. To
download a file, one needs to find and open the torrent created and
start downloading files piece by piece. The peers can also share the
pieces with any other interested party trying to download the same
files. This sharing enhances easy file downloads as more pieces of
data can be found in multiple sources. BitTorrent provides faster
download speeds at a significantly low bandwidth as a result of
breaking down files into smaller pieces.

I do not feel comfortable using BitTorrent mainly due to the security
issues associated with them. When downloading files from multiple
sources, the computers and the network are at risk of getting infected
with viruses, malware, and spyware programs. Another major security
concern is the directive on the torrent website to leave the computer
running so that files can be shared with other peers. This renders the
computer prone to numerous types of cyber-attacks, regardless of
whether or not one has anti-virus protection on one's computer.
Additionally, I feel uncomfortable with BitTorrent because it does not
offer anonymity to my IP address, which means anybody can view my IP
address while I am downloading files using the BitTorrent platform.

Having used BitTorrent extensively and having done an in-depth study
about its security systems, I conclude that it is too risky to be
used, because the drawbacks in the system far outweigh the benefits.
Though, there have been advancements, such as seed boxes, to promote
anonymity and to solve some system irregularities, full and reliable
integration with the current technology has not yet been achieved.

Bittorrent is P2P communication protocol commonly used for sending and
receiving the large digital files like movies and audioclips.In order
to upload and download file, user have to download bittorrent client
which implement the bittorrent protocol. Bittorrent uses the principle
of swarning and tracking [@www-bittorrent]. It divides the files
in large number of chunk and as soon as file is received it can be
server to the other users for downloading.  So rather than downloading
one entire large file from one source, user can download small chunk
from the different sources of linked users in swarn. Bittorrent
trackers keeps list of files available for transfer and helps the
swarn user find each other.

Using the protocol, machine with less configuration can serve as
server for distributing the files. It result in increase in the
downloading speed and reduction in origin server configuration.
