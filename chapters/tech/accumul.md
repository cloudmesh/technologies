Apache Accumulo, a highly scalable structured store based on Google's
BigTable, is a sorted, distributed key/value store that provides
robust, scalable data storage and retrieval. Accumulo is written in
Java and operates over the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),
which is part of the popular Apache Hadoop project. Accumulo supports
efficient storage and retrieval of structured data, including queries
for ranges, and provides support for using Accumulo tables as input
and output for MapReduce jobs.  Accumulo features automatic
load-balancing and partitioning, data compression and fine-grained
security labels. Much of the work Accumulo does involves maintaining
certain properties of the data, such as organization, availability,
and integrity, across many commodity-class
machines [@apache-accumulo].
