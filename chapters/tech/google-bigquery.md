### Old Text

Google BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse used for large scale
data analytics [@www-bigquery-documentation] [@www-bigquery].
A user can store and query massive datasets by storing the data in
BigQuery and querying the database using fast SQL queries using the
processing power of Google's infrastructure. In Google BigQuery a user
can control access to both the project and the data based on the his
business needs which gives the ability to others to view and even
query the data [@www-bigquery]. BigQuery can scale the database
from GigaBytes to PetaBytes. BigQuery can be accessed using a Web UI
or a command-line tool or even by making calls to the BigQuery REST
API using a variety of client libraries such as Java, .NET pr
python. BigQuery can also be accessed using a variety of third party
tool. BigQuery is fully managed to get started on its own, so there is
no need to deploy any resources such as disks and virtual machines.

Projects in BigQuery are top-level containers in Google Cloud
Platform [www-bigquery-documentation]. They contain the BigQuery
Data. Each project is referenced by a name and unique ID. Tables
contain the data in BigQuery. Each table has a schema that describes
field names, types, and other information. Datasets enable to organise
and control access to the tables. Every table must belong to a
dataset. A BigQuery data can be shared with others by defining roles
and setting permissions for organizations, projects, and datasets, but
not on the tables within them. BigQuery stores data in the Capacitor
columnar datacformat, and offers the standard database concepts of
tables, partitions, columns, and
rows [@www-bigquery-columnar-storage].


### New Text
     
Google BigQuery [@www-bigquery-cloud-analytics] is intended as a data warehouse that streamlines
access to large datasets without the need of the complicated
intricacies that require DBAs. It is a RESTful information gathering
tool that can use functionality that is similar to a SQL
database. Because it is a Google product, it does require Google
storage which allows it the benefit. Data is managed in a JSON form,
allowing for powerful parser tools/libraries to be utilized in
analysis [@www-bigquery-cloud-analytics].

This tool is effective for data analysts/experts who wish to use data
that is highly scalable and require familiar functionality. Because it
uses a SQL-like query language, on top of Google Storage, with all of
its proprietary scripts and other analytics tools, it can be a
cost-effective way for a small or large company to perform deep
learning applications in simplified VDI and other company
infrastructures [@www-bigquery-client-libraries].

One valuable feature is that separated compute and storage resources
are available. This enables the use of cloud and other big data
analytics by not requiring the storage of all data that is
processed. This causes Google BigQuery to be the leader in a cause
that all big data analysts require for their detailed analytics.

> core technologies whose code name is Dremel" [@Inside_look_at_Google_Bigquery].

Further features of the BigQuery tool include high data availability,
real-time analytics/usage, local storage for foreign companies,
governance for data integrity, and artificial/business intelligence
and machine learning libraries [@bigquery-inside-look]. It also includes other management
tools such as Cost Controls and inventory/management consoles. There
are many public datasets that can be used along with other proprietary
options to further the cause of any customer using this product. Its
management is synchronous with processing which promotes comfort with
the health status of the data in question [@bigquery-inside-look]. As the storage is managed
off-site, Google technicians are able to troubleshoot quickly with
expertise that is otherwise unfound in big data storage and
implementations.
