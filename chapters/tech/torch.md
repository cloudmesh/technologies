Torch is a open source machine learning library, a scientific
computing framework [@www-torch]. It implements LuaJIT
programming language and implements C/CUDA. It implements
N-dimensional array. It does routines of indexing, slicing,
transposing etc. It has in interface to C language via scripting
language LuaJIT. It supports different artificial intelligence models
like neural network and energy based models. It is compatible with
GPU.  The core package of is *torch*. It provides a flexible N
dimensional array which supports basic routings. It has been used to
build hardware implementation for data flows like those found in
neural networks.
