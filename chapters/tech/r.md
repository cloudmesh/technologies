R [@www-r-project] is a free implementation of the S programming language, which was
originally created and distributed by Bell Labs. It can be used to
perform anything from basic to advanced statistical and graphical
techniques.

The many advantages of R include its package ecosystem. Developers
agree that if a statistical technique exists then there is a good
chance that a package for this function already exists. Being
open-source, r allows new packages to be written and shared among
programmers. R can also be integrated with other programming languages
like C and C++. There is however one disadvantage to using R - it can
consume all available memory.

R code can be run without any compiler owing to the fact that it is an
interpreted language. This makes the development of code easier.
Being a vector language, you can add functions to a single Vector
without implementing a loop. Hence, R is more faster than other
languages. R is utilised in many fields from biology to genetics and
statistics among others.

The question here would be why use R when software like MS Excel,
Matlab, SAS etc exist. Its simple, they all have limitations varying
from inability to handle very large datasets to being used for very
specific scenarios and most importantly being expensive.  R Tackes all
these problems. R is good for exploring datasets and ad hoc analysis
[@www-r-or-python]. In addition to statistical analysis, R can
also be used for Data Mining. The most common data mining techniques
include pattern recognition, classification, clustering etc. These
advantages over other statistical software encourage the growing use
of R in cutting edge social science research.
