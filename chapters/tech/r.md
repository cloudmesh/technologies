R is a free implementation of the S programming language, which was originally created and distributed by Bell Labs. It can be used to 
perform anything from basic to advanced statistical and graphical techniques.

The many advantages of R include its package ecosystem. Developers agree that if a statistical technique exists then there is a good 
chance that a package for this function already exists. Being open-source, r allows new packages to be written and shared among 
programmers. R can also be integrated with other programming languages like C and C++. There is however one disadvantage to using R - 
it can consume all available memory.

R code can be run without any compiler owing to the fact that it is an interpreted language. This makes the development of code easier.
Being a vector language, you can add functions to a single Vector without implementing a loop. Hence, R is more faster than other
languages. R is utilised in many fields from biology to genetics and statistics among others.

The question here would be why use R when software like MS Excel, Matlab, SAS etc exist. Its simple, they all have limitations varying 
from inability to handle very large datasets to being used for very specific scenarios and most importantly being expensive. 
R Tackes all these problems. R is good for exploring datasets and ad hoc analysis [@fa18-523-66-r-or-python]. In addition to
statistical analysis, R can also be used for Data Mining. The most common data mining techniques include pattern recognition,
classification, clustering etc. These advantages over other statistical software encourage the growing use of R in cutting edge
social science research.
