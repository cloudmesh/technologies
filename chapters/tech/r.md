R, a GNU project, is a successor to S, a statistical programming
language. It offers a range of capabilities including

> ``programming language, high level graphics, interfaces to other
> languages and debugging.  R is an integrated suite of software
> facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical
> display''.

The statistical and graphical techniques provided by R make it popular
in the statistical community. The statistical techniques provided
include linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
time-series analysis, classification and clustering to name a few
[@www-R]. The number of packages available in R has made it popular
for use in machine learning, visualization, and data operations tasks
like data extraction, cleaning, loading, transformation, analysis,
modeling and visualization. It's strength lies in analyzing data using
its rich library but falls short when working with very large datasets
[@book-R].
