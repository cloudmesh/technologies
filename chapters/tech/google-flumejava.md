FlumeJava is a Java library that is built based on the concepts of
MapReduce to simplify the development, testing, and execution of
dataparallel pipelines [@flumeJava-parallel-pipelines].

FlumeJava is an easier-to-use version of MapReduce, make it simplier
to build operation that process data. FlumeJava can also be integrated
with other applications to allow stream processing instead of batch
processing [@flumejava-wired].

FlumeJava was able to optimize MapReduce tasks and decrease execution
time of MapReduce by allowing roll-back failed job instead of
restarting [@flumejava-bp3].
