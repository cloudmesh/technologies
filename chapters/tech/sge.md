Sun Grid Engine(SGE), currently known as Oracle Grid Engine (OGE) was an 
open-source grid computing computer cluster developed by Sun and later bought by
Oracle and then bought by Univa Corporation in 2013 [@www-sge-wiki].
SGE is the open-source version whereas OGE is the licensed version that is owned
and supported by Univa. Similar to Slurm, SGE is responsible for scheduling and 
managing jobs and is used in high-performance computing clusters.

SGE cluster consist of a head node and computational nodes. Head node usually 
contains a master host that runs the master daemon called *sge_qmaster* that 
controls the scheduling, components, and access permissions.  Computations 
nodes run execution daemon called *sge_execd* that can run three types of 
hosts: administration hosts, submit hosts, and execution hosts. Administration 
hosts can run administrative activities and other tasks such as submitting, 
modifying, monitoring, and deleting jobs. Submits hosts limits to only able to 
submit and control jobs; execution hosts can only execute jobs
[@www-fa18-523-83-sge-softpanorama].

SGE schedules jobs by allowing job submission, push them to queue and execute 
them with resource allocation functionality. SGE utilizes load balancer to 
distribute jobs and prevent resource overload from any specific nodes. SGE also 
allows the ability to monitor jobs to check jobs statuses
[@www-fa18-523-83-sge-bioinformatics]. The last release of open source SGE 
contains additional features such as:

* Job and resource reservation
* Scheduling algorithms and topology-aware scheduling and thread binding
* GUI Installer and SGE Inspect
* Status Report and usage accounting
* Enhanced remote execution
* Multi-clustering cluster queues
* Fault-tolerance scheduling and checkpointing
* Distributed Resource Management Application API
* Job Submission Verifier
* Enhanced remote execution
* Integration with Hadoop and cloud computing service such as Amazon EC2 
[@www-sge-wiki]

Before 2012, the licensed version of SGE, OGE, was used on the cloud for a while
 and could handle thousands of nodes. In 2012, it was tested for scalability on 
 10,000 nodes of Amazon EC2 clusters in 2012. As a result, there are still work 
 to be done to optimize the run on 10,000 nodes and it is believed that OGE can 
 handle all the way up to 20,000 in the future
[@www-fa18-523-83-sge-scalablelogic].

Overall, SGE is a scheduling tool with abilities to manage resource allocation 
and is comparable with previous and recent technologies to support higher 
computing computer clusters.
