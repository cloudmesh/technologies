CloudML a research project initiated by SINTEF in 2011
 [@www-cloudml]. Cloud computing facilitates to shared and
virtualized computer capabilities like storage, memory, CPU, GPU and
networks, to user. There is multiple cloud provider, also the Iaas
(Infrastructure-as-a-service) and Pass (Platform-as-a-service). To
operate multiple cloud for applications, which requires multiple
private, public, or hybrid clouds, limit the capability of each cloud
solution.  Solution provided by such cloud will gets incompatible with
others. So, to providing the solution which can compatible with
multi-cloud platform is a tedious job. To achieve this CloudML
provides a

> "domain-specific modelling language along with run time
> environment" [@www-cloudml].

It provides the interoperability and
provide vendor lock-in, also it provides the solution on specification
of provisioning, deployment, and adaptation concerns of multi-cloud
systems. At design time as well as runtime [@www-cloudml].
CloudML provides two level of abstraction while developing model for
multi-cloud application: (a) Cloud Provider-Independent Model (CPIM),
this specifies the provisioning and deployment.  (b) Cloud
Provider-Specific Model (CPSM), which filters the provisioning and
deployment of multiple cloud application, according to its cloud.
These two abstract approach help CloudML to achieve the multi-cloud
application support [@www-cloudmlwiki].
