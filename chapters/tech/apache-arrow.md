Apache arrow allows execution engines to utilize what is known as
Single Input multiple data (SIMD). [@www-arrow] This SIMD is an
operation that allows modern processors to take advantage of this
engine.  Performance is enhanced by grouping relevant data as close as
possible in a column format.  Many programming languages are supported
such a Java, C, C++, Python and it is anticipated that languages will
be added as it grows.  It is still in early development but has
released a 0.1.0 build.
