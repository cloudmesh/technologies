> "Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
> distributed message passing.  The focus of celery is mostly on
> real-time operation, but it equally scheduling.  In celery there are
> execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single
> or more worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet,or gevent.
> Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or
> synchronously (wait until ready).  Celery is easy to integrate with
> web framework. Celery is written in python whereas the protocol can
> be implemented in any language" [@celery].



> "Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to
