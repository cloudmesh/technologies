Apache Spark which is an open source cluster computing framework has
emerged as the next generation big data processing engine surpassing
Hadoop MapReduce.

> "Spark engine is developed for in-memory processing as well a disk
> based processing. This system also provides large number of
> impressive high level tools such as machine learning tool M Lib,
> structured data processing, Spark SQL, graph processing took Graph
> X, stream processing engine called Spark Streaming, and Shark for
> fast interactive question device."

The ability of spark to join
datasets across various heterogeneous data sources is one of its
prized attributes. Apache Spark is not the most suitable data analysis
engine when it comes to processing (1) data streams where latency is
the most crucial aspect and (2) when the available memory for
processing is restricted.

> "When available memory is very limited, Apache Hadoop Map Reduce
> may help better, considering huge performance gap."

In cases where latency is the most crucial aspect we can get
better results using Apache Storm [@www-spark].
