SAP HANA is in-memory massively distributed platform that consists of
three components: analytics, relational ACID compliant database and
application\cite{www-sap-hana}. Predictive analytics and machine
learning capabilities are dynamically allocated for searching and
processing of spatial, graphical, and text data.  SAP HANA
accommodates flexible development and deployment of data on premises,
cloud and hybrid configurations.  In a nutshell, SAP HANA acts as a
warehouse that integrates live transactional data from various data
sources on a single platform [@olofson-2014]. It provides
extensive administrative, security features and data access that
ensures high data availability, data protection and data quality.
