### NEW TEXT

Globus online is data transfer management web service which enables one to make a high-performance transfer of complex data. Data transfer occurs without interactions with other systems and the process can restart itself if a problem occurs as well as automatically verify the integrity of the data after a transfer is complete[fa18-523-74-Allcock-2005]. A Globus endpoint on the JASMIN GridFTP server facilitates the process of data transfer using an online tool provided by Globus. An endpoint is a logical address on the GridFTP server that can be said to perform the role of a domain name in a web server. In Globus online, data is transferred between Globus endpoints. One can also communicate via a personal computer using Globus Connect Personal, which creates a personal endpoint to transfer data to and from the personal computer. Multiple environments use the Globus Connect Server, which is Linux based. It is accessible to those who have access to the GridFTP server. 

Globus transfer is easy and reliable. Many large institutions such as universities across the world rely on the Globus to handle their big data. Researchers can exchange big data securely on Globus. Since many individuals and multi-environment use Globus, it is the best platform to meet all types of people and exchange data. The Globus services are aligned to meet all the needs of the scientific research community across the world. Science is revolutionizing because of the ability of researchers to share data for both related and unrelated fields. I feel that Globus is enabling different branches of science to communicate in one language. For example, in cancer research, physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and other disciplines easily interchange data to steer research.



### OLD TEXT
GridFTP is a enhancement on the File Tranfer Protocol (FTP) which
provides high-performance, secure and reliable data transfer for
high-bandwidth wide-area networks. The most widely used implementation
of GridFTP is Globus Online [@www-GlobusOnline]. GridFTP achieves
efficient use of bandwidth by using multiple simultaneous TCP streams.
Files can be downloaded in pieces simultaneously from multiple
sources; or even in separate parallel streams from the same
source. GridFTP allows transfers to be restarted automatically and
handles network unavailability with a fault tolerant implementation of
FTP.The underlying TCP connection in FTP has numerous settings such as
window size and buffer size. GridFTP allows automatic (or manual)
negotiation of these settings to provide optimal transfer speeds and
reliability.
