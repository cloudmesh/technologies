### NEW TEXT


Globus online [@www-toolkit] is data transfer management web service which enables one to make a high-performance transfer of complex data. Data transfer occurs without interactions with other systems and the process can restart itself if a problem occurs as well as automatically verify the integrity of the data after a transfer is complete. A Globus endpoint on the GridFTP server facilitates the process of data transfer using an online tool provided by Globus. An endpoint is a logical address on the GridFTP server that can be said to perform the role of a domain name in a web server. In Globus online, data is transferred between Globus endpoints. One can also communicate via a personal computer using Globus Connect Personal, which creates a personal endpoint to transfer data to and from the personal computer. 

Globus transfer is easy and reliable. Many large institutions such as
universities across the world rely on the Globus to handle their big
data. Researchers can exchange big data securely on Globus. Since many
individuals and multi-environment use Globus, it is the best platform
to meet all types of people and exchange data. The Globus services are
aligned to meet all the needs of the scientific research community
across the world. Science is revolutionizing because of the ability of
researchers to share data for both related and unrelated fields. I
feel that Globus is enabling different branches of science to
communicate in one language. For example, in cancer research, physics,
biology, chemistry, mathematics, and other disciplines easily
interchange data to steer research.
