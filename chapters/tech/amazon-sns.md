Amazon (Simple Notification Service) SNS is a secure messaging 
service that allows decoupling of distributed systems, 
microservices, and serverless applications. Amazons SNS allows for 
high-spanned messaging to a large number of endpoints that 
contributes to parallel processing such as Amazon SQS queues, 
HTTP/S webhooks, and more. SNS can also be used to notify users 
using SMS, email, or mobile push methods. Many users begin use of
Amazon SNS by also using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command
Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).

All messages sent and received on Amazon SNS are stored on multiple 
servers and data centers. Amazon SNS is unique in that it is free 
and does not require the need for installation, upgrade, or other
configuration. Amazon SNS also provides the ability to keep messages
private and contained within an organization. This includes specific
restrictions on who can and cannot publish or subsribe to certain 
topics. There are also configurations which allow filtering of 
messages of interest. For example, this allows only specific topic
related messages to be included in the message thread instead of 
messages from every topic within the user's system. Low-level APIs
are available for learners to use regarding the basics of building
a topic thread. 

Amazon SNS can be distributed in computer applications and data 
stores in business systems. A popular use for Amazon SNS is to 
distribute time-sensitive messages to users on mobile devices. 
Amazon SNS has the advantage of relying on real-time applications
to provide critical notifications. Specific Amazon SNS features 
include topic names that are limited to 256 characters, a unique
Amazon Resource Name that can be referenced later, and an AWS ID
[@fa18-532-52-SNS].
