> ``Apache Sentry [@www-sentry] is a granular, role-based
> authorization module for Hadoop. Sentry provides the ability to
> control and enforce precise levels of privileges on data for
> authenticated users and applications on a Hadoop cluster. Sentry
> currently works out of the box with Apache Hive, Hive
> Metastore/HCatalog, Apache Solr, Impala and HDFS (limited to Hive
> table data). Sentry is designed to be a pluggable authorization
> engine for Hadoop components. It allows the client to define
> authorization rules to validate a user or application's access
> requests for Hadoop resources. Sentry is highly modular and can
> support authorization for a wide variety of data models in Hadoop.''
