SAP HANA(@www-fa18-523-83-sap-saphana] is an in-memory data platform that 
provides database, data integration and quality, in-memory OLAP, and application 
development services [@www-fa18-523-83-sap-saphana]. There are three main areas 
of functionalities in SAP HANA: Database, Analytics, and Web Application; all 
three areas can be integrated efficiently under SAP HANA environment to support 
*real-time* processing needs. 

As a database, SAP HANA is different than traditional relational database in a 
sense that data is stored in memory instead of disk space, which increases 
processing speed tremendously by eliminating the extra step of moving data from 
disk to memory. If optimized, SAP HANA can support up to a petabyte of storing 
column-oriented, in-memory database with quick query processing power 
[@www-fa18-523-83-sap-hana-wiki]. SAP HANA can also combine Online Analytical 
Processing (OLAP) with Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases to support 
real-time processing, data analysis and reporting 
[@www-fa18-523-83-symmetrycorp-saphana]. 

In the Analytics space, SAP HANA is capable of processing spatial, graph, 
search, and text data and performing tasks such as prediction, streaming, time 
series, and machine learning [@www-fa18-523-83-sap-saphana].

Furthermore, SAP HANA is a web-based application server that hosts applications 
that utilize accessing, analyzing and processing data from its database. SAP 
HANA engine supports Node.js and JavaEE and allows the capability to support 
languages that is not in its native language [@www-fa18-523-83-sap-hana-wiki].

Aside from the three key main functionalities, SAP HANA also provides 
administration and security tools to help monitoring processes, support 
continuous availability, and keep data and application secured by utilizing 
encryption and access management controls [@www-fa18-523-83-sap-hana-features].

SAP HANA can be integrated with Hadoop and Spark, or other applications to store
 and access data inexpensively, it can also be implemented on popular cloud 
 servers, such as Azure or AWS, to decrease cost of hosting and maintaining 
 hardware and servers [@www-fa18-523-83-symmetrycorp-saphana].
