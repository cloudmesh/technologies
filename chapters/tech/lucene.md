Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library [@www-lucene].  It is originally written in pure Java but
also has been ported to few other languages chiefly python.  It is
suitable for applications that requires full-text search.  One of the
key implementation of Lucene is Internet search engines and local,
single-site searching.  Another important implementation usage is its
recommendation system. The core idea of Lucene is to extract text from
any document that contains text (not image) field, making it format
independent.
