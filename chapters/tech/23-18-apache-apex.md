Torrent. It can be used for processing both streams of data and static
files making it more relevant in the context of present day internet
and social media. It is aimed at leveraging the present Hadoop
platform and reducing the learning curve for development of
applications over it. It is aimed at It can used through a simple
API. It enables reuse of code by not having to make drastic changes to
the applications by providing interoperability with existing
