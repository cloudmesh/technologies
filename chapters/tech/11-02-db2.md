DB2 is a Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS). Though
initially introduced in 1983 by IBM to run exclusively on its MVS
(Multiple Virtual Storage) mainframe platform, it was later extended
to other operating systems like UNIX, Windows and Linux. It is used to
store, analyze and retrieve the data and is extended with the support
of Object-Oriented features and non-relational structures with
XML [@www-DB2Intro]. DB2 server editions include: Advanced
Enterprise Server Edition and Enterprise Server Edition (AESE / ESE)
designed for mid-size to large-size business organizations, Workgroup
Server Edition (WSE) designed for Workgroup or mid-size business
organizations, Express -C provides the capabilities of DB2 at no
charge and can run on any physical or virtual systems, Express Edition
designed for entry level and mid-size business organizations,
Enterprise Developer Edition offers single application developer
useful to design, build and prototype the applications for deployment
on the IBM server. DB2 has APIs for REXX, PL/I, COBOL, RPG, FORTRAN,
C++, C, Delphi, .NET CLI, Java, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and many
other programming languages. DB2 also supports integration into the
Eclipse and Visual Studio integrated development
