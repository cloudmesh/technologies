Juju [@www-fa18-523-83-juju-jujucharms-mainpage] is an open source project 
developed by Canonical, makers of Ubuntu, with the main purpose of providing 
a framework that makes it easier to deploy, control, configure, scale, 
integrate, and monitor services on the cloud [@www-fa18-523-83-cloudave]. 
Juju can either be installed directly or be hosted as JAAS, Juju as a Service, 
and operates on many popular clouds such as Amazon Web Services, 
Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, VSphere, etc. 
[@www-fa18-523-83-juju-wiki]. 

Juju's heart is a common controller to manage machines on running
application models, also response to system events. Users can interact
with Juju's controller via command line or through its GUI interface.
Juju controller can manage multiple models and their VMs, access and
authorization, and configuration of the models

One of Juju's advantages is its ability to provide solutions called
charms or bundles, collection of charms, to help simplify its process
and improve user adaptation [@www-fa18-523-83-discoversdk-juju]. Users can
download and access charms on charm store community, each charm
contains all operations needed for it to run as a single application
and can be integrated with other applications. Juju Charm Store lauched on April
3rd, 2012; the store community test their charms very often, allow developers 
to upload new charms, and allow access for public users to all the charms to
increase extensibility and flexibility [@www-fa18-523-83-juju-wiki]. Bundles 
allows the ability to form relationships between charms and their services so
that users can deploy multiple charms in one go. Charms and bundles
perform many DevOps functions such as installation, configuration,
upgrade and update, horizontal server scaling, system health checks,
monitoring, and benchmarking [@www-fa18-523-83-juju-jujucharms].

Juju is often compared or integrated with other alternative DevOps/
service orchestration software such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.
[@www-fa18-523-83-juju-wiki]. Another advantage of Juju comparing to other
software is its dynamic configuration ability which makes it easier to
re-configure and modify relationship between services
