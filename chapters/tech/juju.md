As cloud technologies become more popular, the demand of having a framework to deploy and manage codes in the cloud increases. Juju is an open source project developed by Canotical with the main purpose of providing a framework that makes it easier to deploy, control, configure, scale, integrate, and monitor services in the cloud [fa18-523-83-@cloudave]. 

Juju's two components include a client and a bootstrap node; Juju's environment can be installed on many popular clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, and so on [fa18-523-83-@juju-wiki].

Juju is often compared or intergrated with other alternative DevOps/ service orchestration softwares such as Ansible, Chef, Pupper, etc. [fa18-523-83-@juju-wiki]. One of Juju's advantages is its ability to provide solutions called charms or bundles, collection of charms, 
to help simplify its process and improve user adaptation [fa18-523-83-@discoversdk-juju].
