As cloud technologies become more popular, the demand of having a
framework to deploy and manage codes in the cloud increases. Juju is
an open source project developed by Canonical, makers of Ubuntu, with
the main purpose of providing a framework that makes it easier to
deploy, control, configure, scale, integrate, and monitor services on
the cloud [@www-fa18-523-83-cloudave]. Juju can either be installed
directly or be hosted as JAAS, Juju as a Service, and operates on many
popular clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google
Compute Engine, OpenStack, VSphere, etc. [@www-fa18-523-83-juju-wiki].

Juju's heart is a common controller to manage machines on running
application models, also response to system events. Users can interact
with Juju's controller via command line or through its GUI interface.
Juju controller can manage multiple models and their VMs, access and
authorization, and configuration of the models

One of Juju's advantages is its ability to provide solutions called
charms or bundles, collection of charms, to help simplify its process
and improve user adaptation [@www-fa18-523-83-discoversdk-juju]. Users can
download and access charms on charm store community, each charm
contains all operations needed for it to run as a single application
and can be integrated with other applications. Bundles allows the
ability to form relationships between charms and their services so
that users can deploy multiple charms in one go. Charms and bundles
perform many DevOps functions such as installation, configuration,
upgrade and update, horizontal server scaling, system health checks,
monitoring, and benchmarking [@www-fa18-523-83-juju-jujucharms].

Juju is often compared or integrated with other alternative DevOps/
service orchestration software such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.
[@www-fa18-523-83-juju-wiki]. Another advantage of Juju comparing to other
software is its dynamic configuration ability which makes it easier to
re-configure and modify relationship between services

Overall, Juju has its own competitive advantages/disadvantages and
functionalities that distinguish it from other DevOps software.
