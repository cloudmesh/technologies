As cloud technologies become more popular, the demand of having a framework to deploy and manage codes in the cloud increases. Juju is an open source project developed by Canonical, makers of Ubuntu, with the main purpose of providing a framework that makes it easier to deploy, control, configure, scale, integrate, and monitor services on the cloud [@fa18-523-83-cloudave]. Juju can either be installed directly or be hosted as JAAS, Juju as a Service, and operates on many popular clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, VSphere, etc. [@fa18-523-83-juju-wiki].

Juju‘s heart is a common controller to manage machines on running application models, also response to system events. Users can interact with Juju’s controller via command line or through its GUI interface. Juju controller can manage multiple models and their VMs, access and authorization, and configuration of the models [@fa18-523-83-juju-jujucharms]. 

One of Juju's advantages is its ability to provide solutions called charms or bundles, collection of charms, to help simplify its process and improve user adaptation [@fa18-523-83-discoversdk-juju]. Users can download and access charms on charm store community, each charm contains all operations needed for it to run as a single application and can be integrated with other applications. Bundles allows the ability to form relationships between charms and their services so that users can deploy multiple charms in one go. Charms and bundles perform many DevOps functions such as installation, configuration, upgrade and update, horizontal server scaling, system health checks, monitoring, and benchmarking [@fa18-523-83-juju-jujucharms]. 

Juju is often compared or integrated with other alternative DevOps/ service orchestration software such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc. [@fa18-523-83-juju-wiki]. Another advantage of Juju comparing to other software is its dynamic configuration ability which makes it easier to re-configure and modify relationship between services [@fa18-523-83-juju-jujucharms]. 

Overall, Juju has its own competitive advantages/disadvantages and functionalities that distinguish it from other DevOps software.
