Llama stands for leveraging learning to automatically manage
algorithms. There has been a phenomenal improvement in algorithm
portfolio and selection approaches. The main drawback of them is that
their implementation is specific to a problem domain and customized
which leads to the difficulty of exploring new techniques for certain
problem domains. Llama has been developed to provide an extensible
toolkit which can initiate exploration of a variety of portfolio
techniques over a wide range of problem domains. It is modular and
implemented as an R package. It leverages the extensive library of
machine learning algorithms and techniques in R [@lla1]. Llama can
be regarded as a framework which provides the prerequisites for
initiating automatic portfolio selectors. It provides a set of methods
for combining several trivial approaches of portfolio selection into
sophisticated techniques. The primary reason behind the introduction
of Llama was to help the researchers working in algorithm selection,
algorithm portfolios, etc. and can be just used as a tool for
designing the systems [@lla1].
