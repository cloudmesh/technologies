Amazon explains DynamoDB as a fast and flexible NoSQL database service
for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond
latency at any scale [@www.dyndb].  It is a fully managed cloud
database and supports both document and key-value store models.  Its
flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for
mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications.
DynamoDB can be easily integrated with big-data processing tools like
Hadoop. It can also be integrated with AWS Lambda, an event driven
platform, which enables creating applications that can automatically
react to data changes. At present there are certain limits to
DynamoDB. Amazon has listed all the limits in a web page titled
\textit{Limits in DynamoDB }
