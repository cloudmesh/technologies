Sesame is framework which can be used for the analysis of RDF
(Resource Description Framework) data.  Resource Description Framework
(RDF) is a model that facilitates the interchange of data on the
Web [@www-RDF].  Using RFD enables us to merge data even if the
underlying schemas differ.  Sesame has now officially been integrated
into RDF4J Eclipse project [@www-sesame].  Sesame takes in the
natively written code as the input and then performs a series of
transformations, generating kernels for various platforms.  In order
to achieve this, it makes use of the feature identifier, impact
predictor, source-to-source translator and the
auto-tuner [@sesame-paper-2013].  The feature identifier is
concerned with the extraction and detection of the architectural
features that are important for application performance.  The impact
predictor determines the performance impact of the core features
extracted above.  A source-to-source translator transforms the input
code into a parametrized one; while the auto-tuner helps find the
optimal solution for the processor.
