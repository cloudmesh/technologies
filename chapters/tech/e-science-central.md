The e-Science Central is designed to address some of the pitfalls
within current Infrastructure as a Service (e.g.  Amazon EC2) and
Platform as a Service (e.g. force.com)
services [@e-science-central-paper-2010]. For instance, the


> "majority of potential scientific users, access to raw hardware is
> of little use as they lack the skills and resources needed to
> design, develop and maintain the robust, scalable applications they
> require"


and furthermore

> "current platforms focus on services required for business
> applications, rather than those needed for scientific data storage
> and analysis" [@e-science-central-paper-2010].

It is
explained that e-Science Central is a

> "cloud based platform for data analysis"

which is

> "portable and can be run on Amazon AWS, Windows Azure or your own
> hardware" [@www-e-science-central].

Furthermore e-Science Central is described as a platform, which


> "provides both Software and Platform as a Service for scientific
> data management, analysis and collaboration"
> [@e-science-central-paper-2010].

This collaborative platform is
designed to be scalable while also maintaining ease of use for
scientists.  Additionally

> "a project consisting of chemical modeling by cancer researchers"

demonstrates how e-Science Central

> "allows scientists to upload data, edit and run workflows, and
> share results in the cloud" [@e-science-central-paper-2010].
