Agave is an open source, application hosting framework and provides a
platform-as-a-service solution for hybrid
computing [@agave-paper]. It provides everything ranging from
authentication and authorization to computational, data and
collaborative services. Agave manages end to end lifecycle of an
application's execution.  Agave provides an execution platform, data
management platform, or an application platform through which users
can execute applications, perform operations on their data or simple
build their web and mobile applications [@www-agaveapi-features].

Agave's API's provide a catalog with existing technologies and hence
no additional appliances, servers or other software needs to be
installed. To deploy an application from the catalog, the user needs
to host it on a storage system registered with Agave, and submit to
agave, a JSON file that shall contain the path to the executable file,
the input parameters, and specify the desired output location. Agave
shall read the JSON file, formalize the parameters, execute the user
program and dump the output to the requested
destination [@agave-paper].
