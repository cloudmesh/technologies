IBM System G provides a set of Cloud and Graph computing tools and
solutions for Big Data [@IBMSystemGDocumentation-1].  In fact, the
G stands for Graph and typically spans a database, visualization,
analytics library, middleware and Network Science Analytics tools.  It
assists the easy creating of graph stores and queries and exploring
them via interactive visualizations [@IBMSystemGDocumentation-2].
Internally, it uses the property graph model for its working.  It
consists of five individual components - gShell, REST API, Python
interface to gShell, Gremlin and a Visualizer.  Some of the typical
applications wherein it can be used include Expertise Location,
Commerce, Recommendation, Watson, Cybersecurity,
etc [@IBMSystemGPaper].

    However, it is to be noted that the current version does not work
    in a distributed environment and it is planned that future
    versions would support it.
