The word Terraform means in the real world to transform a planet so as to
resemble earth, so that it can support human life. Terraform by Hashicorp is
also used in the same sense. It is used to improve and change the existing
infrastructure, destroy the ones which are no longer used and also create new
ones [@fa18-523-62-www-theregister]. It is one of the most famous open source
infrastructure automation tools. Using Terraform one can define a datacenter in
any configuration language, which can be leveraged to build any infrastructure
or use any cloud service provider such as AWS, Azure. It is primarily written in
Go and can be used on any operating system such as Linux, MacOS, Microsoft
Windows or Solaris. The following features make Terraform as good as it is: It
describes the infrastructure in a high-level configuration level which makes it
extremely effective and reusable. Using this approach, there is a marked
increase in the productivity and considerable decrease in human error. It can be
used to provision resources which are available on any other infrastructure
provider. It allows developers to choose and pick the infrastructure that is
best suited for the application they are running. They are free to provision
their own resources without being bothered about Terraform configurations. Also,
the configurations can be stores as version controls which can be shared and
collaborated with other members of the team [@fa18-523-62-www-terraform].
Currently Terraform has more than 125 infrastructure providers and 1000+
resources. The infrastructure may be defined in HCL terraform syntax or JSON
format. The latest release of Terraform 0.11.0 includes massive improvements to
the registry integration and CLI workflow. There are also large number of
improvements in a number of major providers. Terraform is currently being used
by Uber, Instacart, HotelTonight, Starbucks etc to orchestrate their
infrastructure [@fa18-523-62-stackshare].
