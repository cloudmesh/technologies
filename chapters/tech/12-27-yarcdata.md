Yarcdata is Cray subsidiary providing Analytics products, namely the
Urika Agile Analytics Platform and Graph Engine. Cray's Urika
(Universal RDF Integration Knowledge Appliance) system is a hardware
platform designed specifically to provide high-speed graph-retrieval
for relationship analytics [@www-Urika-appliance].  Urika is a
massively parallel, multi-threaded, shared-memory computing device
designed to store and retrieve massive graph datasets. The system can
import and host massive heterogeneous graphs represented in the
resource description framework (RDF) format and can retrieve
descriptive graph patterns specified in a SPARQL query.

Urika-GD is a big data appliance for graph analytics helps enterprises
gain key insights by discovering relationships in big
data [@techspec-Urika-GD].  Its highly scalable, real-time graph
analytics warehouse supports ad hoc queries, pattern-based searches,
inferencing and deduction. The Urika-GD appliance complements an
existing data warehouse or Hadoop cluster by offloading graph
workloads and interoperating within the existing analytics workflow

Cray Graph Engine is a semantic database using Resource Description
Framework (RDF) triples to represent the data, SPARQL as the query
language and extensions to support mathematical
algorithms [@paper-graph-data].

The paper *Graph mining meets the semantic web* outlines the
implementation of graph mining algorithms using
SPARQL [@paper-lee2015graph].
