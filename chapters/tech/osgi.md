OSGi is a standard which focuses on providing universal gateway for the users. It has been widely use as a framework to integrated all the services for a home. OSGi is widely used by business unit in many specific domains. Starting out in set top boxes and residential gateways OSGi has today been adopted for solutions in IoT, M2M, Smart Home, Telematics, Assisted Living, Healthcare, Automotive, Media, Control Systems, Energy Management, Smart Meters, Telecommunications, Enterprise Software Platforms and Robotics, to name a few.

In 1999, the original name of the organization was *Open Service Gateway initiative*, the aim was to offer service for domestic gateway market. As more and more applications of Java are emerged, they decided to change the name to *OSGi* instead of Open Service Gateway initiative, and the original name should no longer be used.   

The essence of OSGi is a modular system and a service platform for Java, which could offer a useful model. The functions are not existed in the current system. The function is about operation the applications remotely and could do everything with the applications such as start, stop, update or something else. The APIs could also manage the application life cycle though the protocol which designed for the application.   

:o: if its nowadays there must be a different refernce ...

The advantages of OSGi is that it could make the development become simpler, which could be a good news for development's cost budget, the whole amount of the project could be depress to a lower level than before. For developers, the benefit is obvious that bugs are easy to find, code is less to write, the structure could be more easy to design, the result could be more clear about the running process.   

A series of specifications constitute OSGi, a reference implementation for each specification. For the programming language, OSGi could offer a dynamic module system which is made up by some specifications. As versions updating, OSGi is a mature platform to develop complex projects and products in many emerging domains.
