Eduroam is an initiative started in the year 2003 when the number of
personal computers with in the academia are growing rapidly. The goal
is to solve the problem of secure access to WI-FI due to increasing
number of students and research teams becoming mobile which was
increasing the administrative problems for provide access to
WI-FI. Eduroam provides any user from an eduroam participating site to
get network access at any institution connected through
eduroam. According to the orgnizatio in it uses a combination of
radius-based infrastructure with 802.1X standard technology to provide
roaming access across research and educational networks. The role of
the RADIUS hierarchy is to forward user credentials to the users home
institution where they can be verified. This proved to be a successful
solution when compared to other traditional ways like using
MAC-adress, SSID, WEP, 802.1x (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS), VPN Clients,
Mobile-IP etc which have their own short comings when used for this
purpose [@eduroam-paper-2005]. Today by enabling eduroam users get
access to internet across 70 countries and tens of thousands of access
points worldwide [@www-eduroam].
