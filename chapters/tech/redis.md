### NEW TEXT

Redis is an open source in-memory structured query language (SQL) that was developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo while working for VMware, a cloud infrastructure company [@Kepes-2015]. Redis utilizes in-memory storage that makes a website processing speed to be faster. Moreover, its incorporation of Lua scripts adds flexibility to a user's experience.

Redis include 5 data types such as list, set, string, sorted set, and hash. Moreover, it has other two special data types namely hyper log-log and bitmap. Secondly, the system has 160 commands that one can implement to make transactions. Hence, these commands enable a user to have a variety of specialized custom commands. Thirdly, Redis is single-threaded, which means that it is capable of executing one action at a time. This enhances performance since it eradicates any chance of records being locked and enables a user to give numerous requests that can be handled in a sequence without any glitch.

Redis could enable the storage of sessions, compare friends of friends list, and allow one to keep a record of recent visitors.
