Apache project Libcloud [@fa18-523-59-www-libcloud-about], originally developed by Cloudkick, is a universal interface between your program and various API's of all popular cloud providers. It was made an open source package from July 2009. Nowadays, there are several different cloud providers in the market with different API's. It has become extremely difficult to communicate with different cloud providers. Libcloud helps users to call different clouds at one place. It also allows you to interact with the cloud server in a simplified way. It sits between the application and all API's of the cloud providers thereby supporting direct integration with the API's. Libcloud is extensively used by Cloud providers enabling multi-cloud integration.

Libcloud is a python library which allows users to manage their cloud infrastructure and load balances on the cloud. It supports Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3 and PyPy [@fa18-523-59-www-libcloud-about]. Libcloud also provides deployment functionality which makes it easy to bootstrap a server. Installation, upgrading, and use of Libcloud are easy. It handles XML, JASON and also text-based API. Libcloud provides support to more than 50 providers including Microsoft Azure, Apache Cloud stack, Amazon Web Services, OpenStack and VMware.

Resources that can be managed with Libcloud are divided into the following categories. Cloud Servers and Block Storage such as Amazon's EC2 and Rackspace Cloud Servers, Cloud Object Storage and Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as Amazon's S3 and Rackspace Cloud Files, Load Balancers as a Service such as Amazons Elastic Load Balancer and Go Grid Load Balancers, Domain Name System (DNS) as a Service such as Amazon's Route 53. Backup as a Service such as Amazon EBS and OpenStack Freezer. It also provides container-based services. Libcloud supports various methods for different APIs [@fa18-523-59-www-libcloud-documentaion].

While moving an application to the cloud, it is difficult to choose a single provider. Libcloud has prevented vendor lock-in to rely on a single IT infrastructure provider up to a great extent, reducing dependency and allowing organizations to work with different cloud providers at the same time.
