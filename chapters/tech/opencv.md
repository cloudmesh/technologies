OpenCV stands for Open source Computer Vision. It was designed for
computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time
applications. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports
Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. It can take advantage of the
hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform
as it is enabled with OpenCL (Open Computing
Language) [@www-opencv]. OpenCV 3.2 is the latest version of the
software that is currently available [@opencv-version].
