OpenCV [@www-opencv] stands for Open Source Computer Vision which library most commonly used
for detecting anything related to images. With more than 2500 algorithms inside
the library, OpenCV is a type of machine learning framework that works with
image files such as face or object recognition, moving videos where human or
objects are constantly shifting each frame, 3D objects both for modelling and
constructing, image stitching, and other possible frameworks working with
images. As such, OpenCV is available on multiple platforms - supporting popular
operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Android, and Mac -and API for
languages such as C++, Python and Java [@fa18-423-02-opencv].

Having a strong image analysis library, some of the use cases for OpenCV are
Image Enhancement, Wiener Deconvolution, Hough Circles, Mean Shift algorithm,
Image Segmentation, Image Blending, etc. For instances, image enhancement
utilizing OpenCV allows users to improve the image quality from original source.
Image is fed into the framework and will be enhanced through equalization of the
RGB value. Another example would be mean shift algorithm which commonly used for
tracking movement. The framework first recognized the object which the user will
direct on the image, and store the attributes of the object which will then
analyzed as histogram. The framework then follows the movement of the object and
returns the coordinates of the moving object [@fa18-423-02-opencv-use-case].

Besides image analysis, OpenCV also provides statistical machine learning
libraries which become the backbone of the library itself. Those libraries
include Boosting, Decision tree learning, Gradient boosting, k-nearest
algorithm, Naive Bayes classifier, artificial neural networks, support vector
machine, and deep neural networks [@fa18-423-02-wiki-opencv].
