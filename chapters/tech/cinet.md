A representation of connected entities such as

> "physical, biological and social phenomena"

within a predictive
model [@www-bi-vt-edu]. Network science has grown its importance
understanding these phenomena Cyberinfrastructure is middleware tool
helps study Network science,

> "by providing unparalleled computational and analytic environment
> for researcher" [@www-portal-futuresystems-org-projects-233].
 
Network science involves study of graph a large volume which requires
high power computing which usually cant be achieve by
desktop. Cyberinfrastructure provides cloud based infrastructure
(e.g. FutureGrid) as well as use of HPC (e.g. Shadowfax, Pecos). With
use of advance intelligent Job mangers, it select the infrastructure
smartly suitable for submitted job.
     
It provides structural and dynamic network analysis, has number of
algorithms for

> "network analysis such as shortest path, sub path, motif counting,
> centrality and graph traversal".

CiNet has number of
range of network visualization modules.  CiNet is actively being used
by several universities, researchers and analysist.
