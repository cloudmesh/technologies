The latest version of Boto is Boto3 [@www-boto].  Boto3 is the
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Development Kit (SDK) for
Python [@www-boto-github]. It enables the Python developers to
make use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon
EC2 [@www-boto-amazon-python-sdk].  It provides object oriented
APIs along with low-level direct service
 [@www-boto3-documentation].  It provides simple in-built
functions and interfaces to work with Amazon S3 and EC2.

Boto3 has two distinct levels of APIs - client and resource
 [@www-boto-amazon-python-sdk]. One-to-one mappings to underlying
HTTP API is provided by the client APIs. Resource APIs provide
resource objects and collections to perform various actions by
accessing the attributes.  Boto3 also comes with 'waiters'. Waiters
are used for polling status changes in AWS, automatically. Boto3 has
these waiters for both the APIs - client as well as resource.
