Apache parquet is the column Oriented data store for Apache Hadoop
ecosystem and available in any data processing framework, data model
or programming language [@www-parquet]. It stores data such that
the values in each column are physically stored in contiguous memory
locations. As it has the columnar storage, it provides efficient data
compression and encoding schemes which saves storage space as the
queries that fetch specific column values need not read the entire row
data and thus improving performance. It can be implemented using the
Apache Thrift framework which increases its flexibility to work with a
number of programming languages like C++, Java, Python, PHP, etc.
