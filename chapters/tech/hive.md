Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project. Hive is basically built for 
data query and analysis, mainly for data stored in Hadoop files.

The intention of Hive is to simplify the process of operating the MapReduce 
framework, which requires users have advanced understanding of Java 
programming, and to open up Hadoop for a wider group of users 
[@fa18-423-05-searchdatamanagement-techtarget].

The main functions Hive has are data summarization, query and analysis. After 
evolution of Hive, it incorporates more than MapReduce.
