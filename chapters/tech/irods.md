The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) is open source data
management software. iRODS is released as a production-level
distribution aimed at deployment in mission critical environments. It
virtualizes data storage resources, so users can take control of their
data, regardless of where and on what device the data is stored. The
development infrastructure supports exhaustive testing on supported
platforms. The plugin architecture supports microservices, storage
systems, authentication, networking, databases, rule engines, and an
extensible API [@www-irods].  iRODS implements data
virtualization, allowing access to distributed storage assets under a
unified namespace, and freeing organizations from getting locked in to
single-vendor storage solutions. iRODS enables data discovery using a
metadata catalog that describes every file, every directory, and every
storage resource in the iRODS Zone. iRODS automates data workflows,
with a rule engine that permits any action to be initiated by any
trigger on any server or client in the Zone. iRODS enables secure
collaboration, so users only need to log in to their home Zone to
access data hosted on a remote Zone [@github-irods-www].
