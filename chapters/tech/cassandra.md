Apache Cassandra is an open-source distributed database management for
handling large volume of data across commodity
servers [@www-cassandra]. It works on asynchronous masterless
replication technique leading to low latency and high availability. It
is a hybrid between a key-value and column oriented database. A table
in cassandra can be viewed as a multi dimensional map indexed by a
key. It has its own

> ``Cassandra Query language (CQL)'' query language for data
> extraction and mining. One of the demerits of such structure is it
> does not support joins or subqueries. It is a java based system
> which can be administered by any JMX compliant tools.
