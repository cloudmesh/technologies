### NEW TEXT

The volume, diversity, and velocity of data is increasing daily, which
leads to the generation of big data[@fa18-523-74-Joern2009]. Such data
pose immense challenges because it is not easy to process using
analogue technologies. As a result, different technologies, such as
RabbitMQ, have been created to help with the management of big data in
various organizations and institutions.

thia is widely used for the management of big data. Essentially,
it is a message-queuing technology also referred to as a message
manager. Through it, messages can be define and applications can
connect to the queue and relay a message through it. The message may
include any form of communication. Research indicates that it is one
of the most common message brokers. RabbitMQ works by receiving
messages from producers and pushing them to queues based on the rules
and policies that the exchange type outlines. Such message queuing
enables web servers to respond rapidly to requests instead of being
forced to undertake resource heavy procedures abruptly.

It is lightweight and relatively easy to deploy on buildings as well as in the cloud. It
supports diverse messaging protocols. This technology is deployable in
federated as well as distributed configurations to achieve
high-availability and high-scale requests. Furthermore, it can run on
modern could environments, is compatible with most operating systems,
and offers assorted developer tools for most popular languages. I like
the fact that the technology has a feature for message
acknowledgement. However, I noticed that when the volume of data is
extremely large and the consumers are slow, RabbitMQ fails. It handles
about twenty thousand events per second.
