RabbitMQ [@www-rabbitmq] is widely used for the management of big data. 
It is a message-queuing technology which is also referred to as a message
manager. RabbitMq maintains a path from Producer to Consumer to ensure that data is transmitted in a specified way. Research indicates[@fa18-523-74-Yves2014]that it is one
of the most common message brokers. RabbitMQ works by receiving
messages from producers and pushing them to queues based on the rules
and policies that the exchange type outlines. It
enables web servers to respond rapidly to requests instead of being
forced to undertake resource heavy procedures abruptly.


It is lightweight and
relatively easy to deploy on a devices as well as in a cloud. This technology is deployable in
federated as well as distributed configurations to achieve
high-availability and high-scale requests. Furthermore, it can run on most environments people are uesing today, is compatible with most operating systems,
and offers assorted developer tools for most popular languages.
