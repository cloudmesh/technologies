### NEW TEXT

:o: grammar

RabbitMQ [@www-rabbitmq] is widely used for the management of big data. Essentially,
it is a message-queuing technology which also referred to as a message
manager. Through it, messages can be defined and applications can
connect to the queue and relay a message through it. The message may
include any form of communication. Research indicates that it is one
of the most common message brokers. RabbitMQ works by receiving
messages from producers and pushing them to queues based on the rules
and policies that the exchange type outlines. Such message queuing
enables web servers to respond rapidly to requests instead of being
forced to undertake resource heavy procedures abruptly.


It is lightweight and
relatively easy to deploy on buildings as well as in the cloud. It
supports diverse messaging protocols. This technology is deployable in
federated as well as distributed configurations to achieve
high-availability and high-scale requests. Furthermore, it can run on the
modern could environment, is compatible with most operating systems,
and offers assorted developer tools for most popular languages.
