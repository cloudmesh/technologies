MYSQL is one of the most widely used systems to manage relational 
databases, which hold collections of data [@kofler-2005]. The 
data in those collections is structured in tables, which 
are made up of rows and columns [@kofler-2005]. The basic idea 
behind this technology is not only the housing and security of 
the data, but also to allow other tasks such as data querying, 
analysis, sorting, and processing to be performed [@kofler-2005].
Another important component of MySQL are the stored procedures 
that are essentially functions to perfrom certain tasks that
include modifying, updating, inserting, and displaying data.
All tasks can be performed on users' local machines as well as 
on networks, which means that MYSQL can be considered to be a 
database server [@kofler-2005]. The communication between the 
client and the server is completed with the use of the 
standardized Structured Query Language (SQL) [@kofler-2005]. 
Commands written in this language are used to add new data to 
the database or maintain/administer the existing data in the 
database. Depending on which platform the user is utilizing, 
the SQL language may vary in regard to the dialect; however, 
the basic commands such as *SELECT* remain standard across all 
forms of the language. In today's businesses environment, this 
technology is usually used as a back-end application to support 
their front-end applications user interface, due to the language's
stability and speed. Other than these benefits, MYSQL is also 
very easy to learn because the language is very intuitive. It can 
also be easily implemented on most of the popular operating systems 
such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Unix [@kofler-2005]. Even 
though these benefits have made MYSQL an industry standard, this 
technology still has some technical limitations. According to 
some developers, 

> "it is not easy to create incremental back-ups" [@www-mysql-blog],

and 

> "there is no support for XML and OLAP" [@www-mysql-blog]. 

Moreover, in some cases where the amount of data increases 
significantly, the query speed may be noticeably compromised.
