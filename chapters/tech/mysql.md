MYSQL is one of the most widely used systems to manage relational 
databases, which hold collections of data [@kofler-2005]. Considering 
there are many different ways to go about managing relational 
databases [@www-smartsheet]. The data is structured in tables, which 
are made up of rows and columns [@kofler-2005]. The basic idea behind 
this technology is not only the housing and security of the data, 
but also to allow other tasks such as data querying, analysis, 
sorting, and processing to be performed [@kofler-2005]. The tasks can be 
performed on users' local machines as well as on networks, which means 
that MYSQL can be considered to be a database server [@kofler-2005]. The 
communication between the client and the server is completed with the use 
of the standardized Structured Query Language (SQL) [@kofler-2005]. 
Commands written in this language are used to add new data to 
the database or maintain/administer the existing data in the 
database. Depending on which platform the user is utilizing, 
the SQL language may vary in regard to the dialect; however, 
the basic commands such as *SELECT* remain standard across all 
forms of the language. In today's businesses environment, this 
technology is usually used as a back-end application to support 
their front-end applications user interface, due to the language's
stability and speed. Other than these benefits, MYSQL is also 
very easy to learn because the language is very intuitive. It can also 
be easily implemented on most of the popular operating systems such as 
Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Unix [@kofler-2005]. Even though these 
benefits have made MYSQL an industry standard, this technology still 
has some technical limitations. According to some developers, 

> "it is not easy to create incremental back-ups" [@www-mysql-blog],

and 

> "there is no support for XML and OLAP" [@www-mysql-blog]. 

Moreover, in some cases where the amount of data increases 
significantly, the query speed may be noticeably compromised.
