Apache Trident is a

Similarly to Apache Storm, Apache
Trident was developed by Twitter.  Furthermore, Trident as a tool

> distributed querying" [@www-trident-tutorial].

The five kinds of
operations in Trident are described as

> "Operations that apply locally to each partition and cause no
> network transfer, repartitioning operations that repartition a
> stream but otherwise don't change the contents (involves network
> transfer), aggregation operations that do network transfer as
> part of the operation, operations on grouped streams and
> "merges and joins" [@www-trident-overview].


These five kinds of operations (i.e. joins, aggregations, grouping,
functions, and filters) and the general concepts of Apache Trident are
described as similar to
