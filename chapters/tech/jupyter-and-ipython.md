The Jupyter Notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook web
application that allows you to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory
text [@www-jupyter-1]. The notebook extends the console-based
approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction,
providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole
computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as
well as communicating the results [@www-jupyter-2]. The Jupyter
notebook combines two components:
    
1. A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring
of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations
and their rich media output.

2. Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the
web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations,
explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations
of objects.

Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML
(for example, for blog posts), reStructuredText, LaTeX, PDF, and slide
shows, via the nbconvert command [@www-jupyter-3].  Notebook
documents contains the inputs and outputs of a interactive session as
well as additional text that accompanies the code but is not meant for
execution [@www-jupyter-4]. In this way, notebook files can
serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving
executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich
representations of resulting objects [@www-jupyter-wiki]. These
documents are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb
extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be
version-controlled and shared with colleagues [@www-jupyter-6].
