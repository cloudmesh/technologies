Apache Beam attempts to abstract away the need to write code for
multiple data-oriented workflows, e.g., batch, interactive and
streaming, as well as multiple big data tools, e.g., Storm, Spark and
Flink.  Instead, Beam attempts to automagically map a dataflow process
written in Java or Python to the target runtime environment via
\textit{runners}.  As a result, switching a data processing routine from
Spark to Flink only requires changing the target runtime environment
as opposed to re-writing the entire
process [@www-infoworld-apachebeam] (perhaps in a completely
different language).  Google contributed its Dataflow SDK, the
Dataflow model and three runners [@www-datanami-apachebeam] to the
Apache Software Foundation in the first half of 2016.  The ASF
elevated Beam to a Top-Level project in January 2017.  Jean-Baptiste
Onofre of French tech company Talend, and a frequent Apache project
contributor, champions the project. [@www-talend-apachebeam] It
should be grouped with the technologies in the \textit{Interoperability}
section.
