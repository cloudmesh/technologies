Gitreceive is used to create an ssh+git user which can accept
repository pushes right away and also triggers a hook
script. Gitreceive is used to push code anywhere as well as extend
your Git workflow.

> "Gitreceive dynamically creates bare repositories with a special
> pre-receive hook that triggers your own general gitreceive hook
> giving you easy access to the code that was pushed while still being
> able to send output back to the git user"


Gitreceive can also be used to provide feedback to the user not only
just to trigger code on git push.  Gitreceive can used for the
following:

> "(a) for putting a git push deploy interface in front of App Engine
> (b) Run your company build/test system as a separate remote (c)
> Integrate custom systems into your workflow (d) Build your own
> Heroku e)Push code anywhere" [@lindsay2016].
