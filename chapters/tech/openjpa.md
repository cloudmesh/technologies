Apache OpenJPA is a Java persistence project developed by The Apache
Software Foundation that can either be used as Plain old Java Object
(POJO) or could be used in any Java EE compliant containers. It
provides object relational mapping which effectively simplifies the
storing of relational dependencies among objects in
databases [@www-openjpa].  Kodo, an implementation of Java Data
Objects acted as a precursor to the development of
OpenJPA [@www-openjpa-wiki]. In 2006, BEA Systems donated the
majority of the source code of Kodo to The Apache Software Foundation
under the name OpenJPA. Being a POJO, OPenJPA can be used without
needing to extend prespecified classes, implementing predefined
interfaces and inclusion of annotations. OPenJPA can be used in cases
where the focus of the project is majorly on business logic and has
n<o dependencies on enterprise frameworks.OPenJPA can be implemented
across multiple operating systems, on account of its function of cross
platform support. It is written in Java and a most recent stable
release came out in April 20, 2016 under the version 2.4.1 with Apache
License 2.0.
