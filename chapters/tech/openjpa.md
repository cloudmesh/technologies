### NEW TEXT

Java Persistence Application [@www-openjpa] is a collection of devices and methods used to manage different data bases connected to Java [@www-fa18-523-74-Kevin2007]. JPA is a specification that needs implementation by using other applications. The use of JPA enables an organization to store and manage large amounts of information. The ability of storing large data bases of information is due the ability of the application's configurations to be used automatically in a large storage area.		                 
Being a part of the larger spring data family, the Java Persistent makes it easier to access other data applications and data technologies. The Java application is important in compacting large amounts of information into a sizable one. Similarly, the use of Java persistence can also ensure easy access to information ensuring improved data access by reducing or flattening the processes required.

The use of the Java persistence application can only be done through the use of subscribers such as the Eclipse link. After identifying the suitable link, a JPA project has to be created. This project contains all the Java data bases and other devices connected to Java. Thereafter, one can create a new Java class and subsequently add it to the persistence file.

The use of the JPA among users has created a satisfactory effect among users. Most users find it a reliable option as opposed to the writing down of the different databases. Its effectiveness is due to its ability to use mappings instead of writings, which have reduced so many writings of the data base. To conclude, most user's experience is positive towards the use of JAP makes it easy to load and save objects without necessarily using a specific language. Thus, Java persistence has created satisfaction among its consumers.
