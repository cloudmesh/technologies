The traditional methods of hosting and deploying IT infrastructure 
consists of implementing physical servers in the data centers, the turn 
around time for this task could take a from few days to weeks. It 
typically requires substantial capital investment, energy resources, and 
high efforts. Also, scaling the resources is a cumbersome task to 
accommodate the growing or shrinking needs of hosted applications. The 
cloud computing leverages these disadvantages by using the 
virtualization technique to its core. The cloud, in general, refers to 
hosted services over a network [@www-cloudstackyoutube]. The cloud 
infrastructure provides flexibility of renting, leasing pool of hardware 
and software resources with lesser upfront infrastructure and 
maintenance cost. Many technology startups have come up with different 
innovative products, applications and have used cloud features without 
worrying about the hosted infrastructure. There are many cloud platforms 
like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Rackspace where any individual or 
company can buy cloud services. Unlike the private cloud, the public 
cloud environment consumers do not have control over underlying 
infrastructure. Nowadays hybrid cloud services are more popular and 
blended with both private and public features [@www-cloudstackyoutube]. 
"Apache CloudStack is an open source Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
platform that manages and orchestrates pools of storage, network, and 
computer resources to build a public or private IaaS compute cloud" 
[@www-cloustackconcept]. It has rich management interface compatible 
with the latest browsers. Powerful API, well documented supports AWS s3 
and Ec2.One can use Apache cloud stack to build public-private and 
hybrid cloud environment. It supports all hypervisors for virtualization 
like VMware, XenServer, Oracle VM, KVM, etc. It is primarily written in 
Java and includes rest API and web GUI that allows to manage and 
organize cloud environments [@www-cloudstackconcept]. As the history 
reference stated on the Apache website, The VMOps Startup developed and 
started the project of cloud stack in 2008 and changed the name as 
cloud.com. Eventually, cloud.com was purchased by Citrix in July 2011 
and submitted to Apache incubator in 2012. On March 20, 2013, Apache 
cloud stack graduated from the incubator and the release announced on 
March 25, 2013 [@www-cloudstackhistory]. In most straightforward of the 
architecture, cloud stack consists of the Management server which can 
manage multiple geographically distributed zones and a machine that acts 
as a cloud infrastructure whose resources are needed to be controlled. 
The management server may run on the physical server or VM, in an apache 
tomcat container and requires MySQL database for persistence. At the 
core of its deployment architecture, it consists of a 
hypervisor(virtualization software), a cluster which is a group of 
identical Hosts running a common hypervisor, shared primary storage 
unique to each cluster. Pod with one or more clusters with L2 switches. 
Availability Zones which is the largest unit within cloud stack 
deployment that has one or more Pods and access to secondary storage 
which consists of templates, ISO images or snapshots 
[@www-cloustackconcept]. Today Apache cloud stack services a wide 
variety of customers including Apple, Bell Canada, Zynga, Hwuai. Today 
cloud stack professional has vast job opportunities. Knowledgeable cloud 
stack professionals are in high demand within start-ups and large 
enterprises, As the demand increases the salary and consultation rate is 
also rising [@www-cloudstackyoutube].
