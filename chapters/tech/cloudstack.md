In traditional IT infrastructure scaling the 
resources is a cumbersome task to accommodate the growing or shrinking 
needs of hosted applications. The cloud computing overcomes these 
disadvantages by using the virtualization technique to its core 
[@www-cloudstackyoutube]. Apache cloud stack features on-demand elastic 
cloud computing capabilities like Amazon EC2. Apache Cloudstack has rich 
management interface compatible with the latest browsers. One can use 
Apache cloud stack to build public-private and hybrid cloud environment. 
It supports all hypervisors for virtualization like Hyper-V, XenServer, 
Xen Project, KVM and many more. It is primarily written in Java and 
includes rest API for managing cloud operations and web GUI that allows 
to manage and organize cloud environments to the administrators as well 
as to the end-users to adjust VM templates [@www-cloudstackconcept]. As 
the history reference stated on the Apache website, The VMOps Startup 
developed and started the project of cloud stack in 2008 and changed the 
name as *Cloud.com* and later purchased by Citrix in July 2011 and 
submitted to Apache incubator in 2012. On March 20, 2013, Apache cloud 
stack graduated from the incubator and announcement releasedon on March 
25, 2013 [@www-cloudstackhistory]. In most straightforward of the 
architecture, cloud stack consists of the Management server which can 
manage multiple geographically distributed zones and a machine that acts 
as a cloud infrastructure whose resources are needed to be controlled. 
The management server may run on the physical server or VM, in an apache 
tomcat container and requires MySQL database for persistence. The 
deployment architecture consists of a hypervisor(virtualization 
software), a cluster which is a group of identical hosts running a 
common hypervisor, shared primary storage unique to each cluster. Pod 
with one or more clusters and L2 switches. Zones that has one or more Pods and 
access to secondary storage which consists of templates, ISO images or 
snapshots. And Regions which are collections of proximate zones 
[@www-cloudstackconcept]. Today Apache cloud stack services a wide 
variety of customers including Apple, Bell Canada, Zynga, Huawei. Today 
cloud stack professional has vast job opportunities. Knowledgeable cloud 
stack professionals are in high demand within start-ups and large 
enterprises [@www-cloudstackyoutube].
