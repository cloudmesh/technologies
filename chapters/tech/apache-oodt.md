OODT stands for Object Oriented Data Technology which is funded initially by NASA's Office of Space Science.  OODT is an open source architecture and provided by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache OODT is a data system framework that was built with a vision to share data across heterogeneous and distributed data repositories. It focusses primarily on big data processing and information integration. 

> ``It is both an architecture as well as a framework that enables 
> data production, data discovery, data distribution, data analysis 
> and data access on a large scale'' [@OODTEcosystem].

OODT is very user-friendly. It is very easy to manage the workflow and execute tasks even for a non-programmer. Its processing unit consists of shell scripts that are customizable depending on the workflow. The main components include a file manager, a workflow manager and a resource manager which each manage different modules of the data workflow [@www-oodt].

OODT additionally takes into consideration remote execution of employments on versatile computational foundations so that computational and data-intensive concentrated handling can be coordinated into OODT's data processing pipelines using cloud computing and high-performance computing environments which are intrinsic to OODTs framework [@FanYanMaWang2017]. 
 
Conventional data processing pipelines comprise custom UNIX shell scripts and delicately composed code while Apache OODT employs organized XML-based capturing of data processing pipeline that can be comprehended easily by non-developers to create, alter aid smooth workflow and task execution. OODT spans across different disciplines and enables interoperability among information skeptic frameworks in any field. Apache OODT makes use of Lattice Computing and Apache Mesos to perform various computing operations across distributed systems in addition to utilizing cloud computing services. The enables developers to build highly dispersed, versatile and scalable data platforms that can process even enormous volumes of data effortlessly [@OODTCWiki].
