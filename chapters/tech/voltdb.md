VoltDB is an in-memory database. It is an ACID-compliant RDBMS which
uses a shared nothing architecture to achieve database parallelism. It
includes both enterprise and community editions. VoltDB is a scale-out
NewSQL relational database that supports SQL access from within
pre-compiled Java stored procedures.  VoltDB relies on horizontal
partitioning down to the individual hardware thread to scale, k-safety
(synchronous replication) to provide high availability, and a
combination of continuous snapshots and command logging for durability
(crash recovery) [@www-voltdb]. The in-memory, scale-out
architecture couples the speed of traditional streaming solutions with
the consistency of an operational database. This gives a simplified
technology stack that delivers low-latency response times (1ms) and
hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. VoltDB allows users
to ingest data, analyze data, and act on data in milliseconds,
allowing users to create per-person, real-time
experiences [@www-voltdb].
