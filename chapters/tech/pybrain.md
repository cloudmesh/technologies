The goal of PyBrain is to provide flexible, easy to-use algorithms
that are not just simple but are also powerful for machine learning
tasks [@article-pybrain].  The algorithms implemented are Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), policy gradient methods, (multidimensional)
recurrent neural networks and deep belief networks. These algorithms
include a variety of predefined environments and benchmarks to test
and compare algorithms.

PyBrain provides a toolbox for supervised, unsupervised and
reinforcement learning as well as black-box and multi-objective
optimization as it is much larger than Python libraries.

PyBrain implements many recent learning algorithms and architectures
while emphasizing on sequential and nonsequential data and
tasks. These algorithms range from areas such as supervised learning
and reinforcement learning to direct search / optimization and
evolutionary methods.  For application-oriented users, PyBrain
contains reference implementations of a number of algorithms at the
bleeding edge of research and this is in addition to standard
algorithms which are not available in Python library. Besides this
PyBrain sets itself apart by its versatility for composing custom
neural networks architectures that range from (multi-dimensional)
recurrent networks to restricted Boltzmann machines or convolutional
networks.
