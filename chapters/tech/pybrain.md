Pybrain is an open source machine learning library for python. Pybrain is a research project and it is developed by the researchers at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial intelligence in Switzerland and Technical university of Munich, Germany. Pybrain can be independently used and its only dependency is on SciPy.

> "While there are a few machine learning libraries out there, PyBrain aims to be a very easy-to-use modular

PyBrain can compose custom neural network architectures that vary from recurrent networks that are multi-dimensional to Boltzmann machines also known as convolutional networks. And in this way, it is different from the other Machine Learning Libraries.

PyBrain can be extensively use for Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi supervised and Reinforcement learning and black box for parallel optimization. PyBrain also supports various Artificial neural networks. PyBrain has methods and sub library that supports plotting functions, read and write to the XMLs. We can do implicit mapping using PyBrain and use it as an implicit layer to build Gamming and 3D environments. It is also used to overcome the problems of continuous state and action spaces associated with the real-life tasks.

Pybrain includes various training algorithms, data handling tools and environments that work with sequential and non-sequential data. PyBrain architectures includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Belief Networks with the prominent ones being the Feedforward Network and Recurrent Network the Feedforward Network is nothing but an artificial neural network establishing a connection between the nodes unlike the Recurrent Networks where a set of vertices connected by the edges are formed along the sequence by connecting the nodes. It allows multiple algorithms to be incorporated together to get the best possible results. PyBrain stands out among other machine learning library in python because of its simplicity and convenient way of applying most advanced AI algorithm [@fa18-523-59-www-pybrain-paper].
