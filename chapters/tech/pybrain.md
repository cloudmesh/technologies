Pybrain [:o: refernce missing ] is an open source machine learning library for python. Pybrain
is a research project and it is developed by the researchers at the
Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial intelligence in Switzerland and
Technical university of Munich, Germany. Pybrain can be independently
used and its only dependency is on SciPy.

PyBrain can compose custom neural network architectures that vary from
recurrent networks that are multi-dimensional to Boltzmann machines
also known as convolutional networks. And in this way, it is different
from the other Machine Learning Libraries.

PyBrain can be extensively use for Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi
supervised and Reinforcement learning and black box for parallel
optimization. PyBrain also supports various Artificial neural
networks. PyBrain has methods and sub library that supports plotting
functions, read and write to the XMLs. We can do implicit mapping
using PyBrain and use it as an implicit layer to build Gamming and 3D
environments. It is also used to overcome the problems of continuous
state and action spaces associated with the real-life tasks.

Pybrain includes various training algorithms, data handling tools and
environments that work with sequential and non-sequential data.
PyBrain architectures includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep
Belief Networks with the prominent ones being the Feedforward Network
and Recurrent Network the Feedforward Network is nothing but an
artificial neural network establishing a connection between the nodes
unlike the Recurrent Networks where a set of vertices connected by the
edges are formed along the sequence by connecting the nodes. It allows
multiple algorithms to be incorporated together to get the best
possible results. PyBrain stands out among other machine learning
library in python because of its simplicity and convenient way of
applying most advanced AI algorithm [@article-pybrain].
