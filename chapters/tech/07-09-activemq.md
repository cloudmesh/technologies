Apache ActiveMQ is a powerful open source messaging and Integration
Patterns server [@www-activeMQ]. It is a message oriented
middleware (MOM) for the Apache Software Foundation that provides high
availability, reliability, performance, scalability and security for
enterprise messaging [@ActiveMQ-book]. The goal of ActiveMQ is to
provide standard-based, message-oriented application integration
across as many languages and platforms as possible. ActiveMQ
implements the JMS spec and offers dozens of additional features and
value on top of this specifications. ActiveMQ is used in many
scenarios such as heterogeneous application integration, as a
replacement for RPC and to loosen the coupling between applications.
