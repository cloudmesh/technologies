Solandra is a highly scalable real-time search engine built on Apache
Solr and Apache Cassandra. Solandra simplifies maintaining a large
scale search engine, something that more and more applications
need. At its core, Solandra is a tight integration of Solr and
Cassandra, meaning within a single JVM both Solr and Cassandra are
running, and documents are stored and distributed using Cassandra's
data model [@github-solandra].

Solandra supports most out-of-the-box Solr functionality (search,
faceting, highlights), multi-master (read/write to any node). It
features replication, sharing, caching, and compaction managed by
Cassandra [@github-solandra2].
