Apache Drill is an open source framework that provides schema free SQL
query engine for distributed large-scale
datasets [@www-ApacheDrill]. Drill has an extensible architecture
at its different layers. It does not require any centralized metadata
and does not have any requirement for schema specification. Drill is
highly useful for short and interactive ad-hoc queries on very large
scale data sets. It is scalable to several thousands of nodes. Drill
is also capable to query nested data in various formats like JSON and
Parquet. It can query large amount of data at very high speed. It is
also capable of performing discovery of dynamic schema.  A service
called 'Drillbit' is at the core of Apache Drill responsible for
accepting requests from the client, processing the required queries,
and returning all the results to the client.  Drill is primarily
focused on non-relational datastores, including Hadoop and NoSQL
