MLBase is a distributed machine learning system built with Apache
Spark [@www-spark], [@www-mlbase].  Machine Learning (ML) and
Statistical analysis are tools for extracting insights from big data.
MLbase is a tool for execute machine learning algorithms on a scalable
platform. It consist of three components MLLib, MLI and ML
Optimizer. MLLib was initially developed as a part of MLBase project
but is now a part of Apache Spark. MLI is an experimental API for
developing ML algorithm and to extract information. It provides
high-level abstraction to the core ML algorithms. A prototype is
currently implemented against Spark. ML optimizer on the other hand is
use to automate the MLI pipeline construction. It solves for the
search problem over feature extractors and ML algorithms included in
MLI and ML lib. This library is its in early stage and under active
development. Several publications are available on distributed machine
learning with MLBase [@mlbasepub1], [@mlbasepub2]
and [@mlbasepub3].
