Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel computing API, 
[@www-singh2014cuda] and a general-purpose GPU 
(graphics processing unit) developed by NVIDIA where the code written, interacts
directly with the GPU. It is used as the computing engine and has a unique 
architecture well suited to tackle large computations in big data processing.
CUDA, which was used to render video and images, are also being used to solve
mathematics problems which are computationally intensive in a cost-effective way.
CUDA based systems are used in the training of deep learning algorithms [@www-singh2014cuda].

CUDA based systems has drastically reduced the time taken to train those
algorithms that process large data sets in parallel to just few hours compared
to the CPU based systems, which usually takes a long time. The CUDA GPUs are also
used in a wide variety of applications that are not related only to graphics:

-	They are used in the field of computer vision and speech recognition by 
  leveraging deep learning. 
-	Data mining and analytics
-	Medical imaging
-	Geo-intelligence etc [@www-columbialeccuda].

CUDA shares some of its computing interface with Open Computing
Language (OpenCL) even though it has its own application programming
Interface (API) [@www-bigdatatipscuda].

> "The CUDA Architecture included a unified shader pipeline, allowing each and
every arithmetic logic unit (ALU) on the chip to be marshaled by a program 
intending to perform general-purpose computations" [@www-singh2014cuda].

CUDA supports most Windows,Linux, and Mac OS compilers.Hadoop platform 
using Nvidia CUDA architecture was used as a solution to handle fastest
growing data in form of platforms or infrastructures for processing/computation
[@www-singh2014cuda].

The CUDA processing flow has four main steps:

-	Copy data from main memory to GPU memory.
-	CPU instructs the process to GPU.
-	GPU executes parallel in each core. 
-	Copy the results from GPU to main memory.

Some examples where CUDA is used:

- Video file format interconversion
- 3D Graphics generation
- Compression of files
- Face recognition
- Distributed Computing 
[@www-wikicuda].

Some more examples include:

-	Molecular dynamics
-	Simulating the motion of fluids using the numerical methods.
-	Environmental Science
