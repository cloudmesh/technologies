HUBzero is a collaborative framework which allows creation of dynamic
websites for scientific research as well as educational activities.
HUBzero lets scientific researchers work together online to develop
simulation and modeling tools.  These tools can help you connect with
powerful Grid computing resources as well as rendering
farms [@hubzerowebsite]. Thus allowing other researchers to access
the resulting tools online using a normal web browser and launch
simulation runs on the Grid infrastructure without having to download
or compile any code. It is a unique framework with simulation and
social networking capabilities [@hubzeropaper2010].
