In June 2009, Google released their free cloud based webservice, Google Fusion Tables, whose main purpose was to make management of data simpler, such that any novice can easily manage, share, visualize their data and collaborate with others while working on them.[@fa18-523-71-GFTwiki] It also provides a platform to establishments which want to share their data privately, publicly or to users who want to collaborate across multiple enterprises.  

Fusion tables has a REST API where the user can merge different tables from different sources. If needed a user can also make their data public thereby making it crawlable by search engines. Apart from integration, Google Fusion Tables provides a mirage of ways to visualize data in terms of different plots (e.g., scatter, bar etc.), charts, maps etc. and play with them. The visualizations provided by GFT work through Google Visualization API, once made a visualization can be embedded on any website by copying it's javascript code fragment provided by GFT.  The most famous of the visualizations provided by GFT is the Map. Users can add geographical information to their data and GFT uses google Maps to come with the respective visualizations.

Currently, Google lets 250 MB of data per dataset, and provides 1 GB quota per user . The data can be from variety of sources like Excel files (.xls, .xslx, .ods), CSV files (Comma delimited), KML, TSV ( any text delimited file) and also can chose data from public data available on Google Tables or millions of public tables from the web using GFT search engine. To encourage the data sharing, Google has many mechanisms that offer incentives to the users. To improve collaboration experience, GFT acts as the platform where multiple users can discuss about the authenticity, meaning and correctness of data.[@fa18-523-71-GFT]

Storing and processing the massive amounts of data (tables, schemas, queries etc.) is a challenge faced by GFT, which has been tackled by having an impeccable architecture in place to manage it.  It's assembled on two layers of Google storage stack, which go by the name Bigtable and Megastore. Bigtable stores key value pairs, distributed among several servers based on key ranges, and every time a new table is made, it's added as a tuple automatically. It also stores the meta data of the tables such as transaction history in the tuples. Megastore is a library added above Bigtable which helps with maintaining consistent indexes, table transactions and replication of tables.  The rows in a table are stored as one row in a single Bigtable that is dedicated to store all the user tables in GFT. Similarly, schemas of all user tables are stored in a Bigtable. In this way the Bigtable and Megastore help GFT have a scalable storage of data. [@fa18-523-71-GFTpaper]

Being an experimental application from Google Research, GFT seems to be the next big tool for fast and easy database management.[@fa18-523-71-GFT]
