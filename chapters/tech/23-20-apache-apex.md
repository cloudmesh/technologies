The Apex platform is designed to process real-time events with
streaming data natively in Hadoop. The platform handles application
execution, dynamic scaling, state checkpointing and recovery,
etc. This allows the users to focus on writing their application logic
without mixing operational and functional
concerns [@apache-apex]. In the platform, building a streaming
application is easy and intuitive.

An application may consist of one or more operators each of which
define some logical operation to be done on the tuples arriving at the
operator. These operators are connected together to form streams. A
streaming application is represented by a DAG that consists of
operators and streams [@apex-operators]. The Apex platform comes
with support for web services and metrics. This enables ease of use
and easy integration with current data pipeline components. DevOps
teams can monitor data in action using existing systems and dashboards
with minimal changes, thereby easily integrating with the current
setup. With different connectors and the ease of adding more
connectors, Apex easily integrates with an existing
dataflow [@apex-ease].
