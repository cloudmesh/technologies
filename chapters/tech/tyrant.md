Tyrant provides network interfaces to the database management system
called Tokyo Cabinet. Tyrant is also called as Tokyo Tyrant. Tyrant is
implemented in C and it provides APIs for Perl, Ruby and C. Tyrant
provides high performance and concurrent access to Tokyo Cabinet. The
results of performance experiments between Tyrant and Memcached and
MySQL can be viewed in the blog [@www-tyrant-blog].

Tyrant was written and maintained by FAL Labs [@www-tyrant-fal-labs].
However, according to FAL Labs, their latest product Kyoto Tycoon is
more powerful and convenient server than Tokyo Tyrant
[@www-kyoto-tycoon].

## New text

Tokyo Tyrant is comprised of several packages of network interfaces
that link to a complex database management system entitled Tokyo
Cabinet [@www-tyrant-fal-labs]. The Tokyo Cabinet is a set of routines
used for the management of key-value databases, and was initially
sponsored by the Japanese social media site Mixi
[@www-en-wikipedia-tyrant]. Tokyo Tyrant provides a variety of methods to
connect to the Tokyo cabinet database manager. The application
includes a process whereby allowing for effective database management
as well as its access library for client base applications
[@www-tyrant-fal-labs].

Below is some additional technical information from the fallabs website:


> "The server features high concurrency due to thread-pool modeled
> implementation and the epoll/kqueue mechanism of the modern
> Linux/*BSD kernel. The server and its clients communicate with each
> other by simple binary protocol on TCP/IP. Protocols compatible with
> memcached and HTTP are also supported so that almost all principal
> platforms and programming languages can use Tokyo Tyrant. High
> availability and high integrity are also featured due to such
> mechanisms as hot backup, update logging, and replication. The
> server can embed Lua, a lightweight script language so that you can
> define arbitrary operations of the database"
> [@www-tyrant-fal-labs-specs].


You must install Tokyo Cabinet prior to using Tokyo Tyrant. The Tokyo
Tyrant application is extracted into a new working directory location
whereby a configuration script can be executed to complete the
installation. The ttserver command is vital to the operation of the
server, as well as determining the best usage of memory for the
application.

> "The command *ttserver* runs the server managing a database
> instance. Because the database is treated by the abstract API of
> Tokyo Cabinet, you can choose the scheme on start-up of the server.
> Supported schema are on-memory hash database, on-memory tree
> database, hash database, and B+ tree database. This command is used
> in the following format. `dbname' specifies the database name. If it
> is omitted, on-memory hash database is specified"

A new, more robust version of Tokyo Cabinet entitled Kyoto Cabinet has
been released and has taken the place of the original Tokyo Cabinet
platform. The Kyoto Cabinet exhibits extraordinarily fast performance 
using a smaller footprint, and is very scaleable. Kyoto Cabinet was 
developed using the C++ language and can be leveraged as an API within 
the Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Lua. [@www-kyotocabinet]. A newly 
released database server, Kyoto Tycoon, works in tandem with Kyoto Cabinet 
to manage the intricate web of network connections and server processes 
for the applications for which it supports. Kyoto Tycoon is capable of 
managing concurrent network connections to Kyoto Cabinet and functions 
primarily as a remote network interface.  Kyoto Cabinet, used in conjunction 
with Kyoto Tycoon, is the next step up for the Tokyo Tyrant platform and is 
touted as being far superior and highly recommended as a necessary replacement. 
Fal Labs, the architects of Tokyo Tyrant strongly recommend upgrading in order 
to take advantage of the new features of Kyoto Cabinet and Kyoto Tycoon 
[@www-tyrant-fal-labs].
