Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud application platform available 
through public and private cloud distributions developed initially 
in-house at *VMware* and mainly written in Java, Ruby, and Go 
[@www-cloudfoundrywiki]. 

In today's era, many organizations are facing 
the challenge of migrating their applications to the cloud and 
decommissioning the old infrastructure. It is a challenging task to make 
applications cloud native, means unaware of the underlying 
infrastructure that cloud services are providing. Cloud Foundry shines 
by providing the platform that makes application agnostic of 
infrastructure and runs smoothly leveraging cloud resources thereby 
reducing development cycle runtime [@www-cloudfoundryoreilly]. 

Cloud Foundry's dedicated subsystems such as *BOSH*, *CF cloud controller*, and 
*Router* help to serve and scale applications online flexibly 
[@www-cloudfoundrycon]. 

From the computing quality perspectives, Cloud 
Foundry is optimized to deliver performance, scalability, availability, 
resilience, and support multi-tenant compute efficiencies for fast 
application development and deployment. Cloud Foundry Supports many 
languages such as Ruby, Java, Scala, Node.js, Python, and flexibility to 
deploy them on multi-cloud Iaas environments sthat include OpenStack, AWS, 
and VSphere. It also allows developers to run their code on multiple 
database services such as MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ. 
The open source PaaS is highly customizable which makes deploying and scaling 
applications fast and secure [@www-cloudfoundryacad]. 

The Cloud Foundry architecture includes seven core groups of components 
which provide a platform for application deployment, lifecycle management, 
integration to other services such as databases or third-party SaaS providers 
and application execution [@www-cloudfoundrycon]. 

Since the Cloud Foundry is an open source project; 
it is available from the Cloud Foundry Foundation as well as from a 
variety of software providers as a product or a service. The Cloud Foundry 
foundation built *BOSH* deployment system to allow Cloud Foundry to 
interact with the underlying infrastructure. The *BOSH* system allows 
deploying software over multiple VM's and also performs monitoring, 
failure recovery, and patching with zero to minimal downtime 
[@www-cloudfoundrywiki]. 

Security is a critical aspect, especially within a shared environment. 
The designated cloud resources may have application accessed by multiple 
consumers or companies. Cloud Foundry mitigates security threats by using 
measures such as *isolation* to customer data and containerized application, 
encryption techniques, role-based access control, and monitoring of resource 
starvation to prevent the possible security attack [@www-cloudfoundrycon]. 

To summarize, Cloud Foundry provides a cloud computing platform to run the 
applications in the secured environment with self-healing capacity, 
centralized management, and ease of integration and maintenance
