Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud application platform available 
through public and private cloud distributions developed initially 
in-house at VMware and mainly written in Java, Ruby and Go 
[@www-cloudfoundrywiki]. In today's era, many organizations are facing 
the challenge of migrating their applications to the cloud and 
decommissioning the old infrastructure. It is a challenging task to make 
applications cloud native, means unaware of the underlying 
infrastructure that cloud services are providing. Cloud foundry shines 
by providing the platform that makes application agnostic of 
infrastructure and runs smoothly leveraging cloud resources thereby 
reducing development cycle runtime [@www-cloudfoundryoreilly]. Cloud 
foundry's dedicated subsystems such as BOSH, CF cloud controller and 
router helps to serve and scale applications online flexibly 
[@www-cloudfoundrycon]. From the computing quality perspectives, Cloud 
Foundry is optimized to deliver performance, scalability, availability, 
resilience and support multi-tenant compute efficiencies for fast 
application development and deployment. Cloud Foundry Supports many 
languages such as Ruby, Java,Scala,Node.js, Python, and flexibility to 
deploy them on multi-cloud Iaas environment includes OpenStack, AWS and 
VSphere. It also allows developers to run their code on multiple 
database services such as MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ. The 
open source PaaS is highly customizable makes deploying and scaling 
applications fast and secure [@www-cloudfoundryacad]. According to the 
Cloud Foundry Foundation, the Cloud Foundry architecture is made up of 
seven core groups of components which provide a platform for application 
deployment, lifecycle management, integration to other services such as 
Databases or third-party SaaS providers and application execution 
[@www-cloudfoundrycon]. As the cloud foundry is an open source project; 
it is available from the cloud foundry Foundation as well as from a 
variety of software providers as a product or service. The cloud foundry 
foundation built BOSH deployment system to allow cloud foundry to 
interact with the underlying infrastructure. The BOSH system allows 
deploying software over multiple VM's and also performs monitoring, 
failure recovery, patching with zero to minimal downtime 
[@www-cloudfoundrywiki]. Security is a critical aspect, especially 
within a shared environment. The designated cloud resources may have 
application accessed by multiple consumers or companies. Cloud foundry 
mitigates security threats with using measures such as Isolation to 
customer data and containerized application, encryption techniques, 
role-based access control, monitoring of resource starvation to prevent 
the possible security attack [@www-cloudfoundrycon]. To summarize, the 
cloud foundry provides a cloud computing platform to run the 
applications in the secured environment with self-healing capacity, 
centralized management, ease of integration and maintenance 
[@www-cloudfoundryacad].
