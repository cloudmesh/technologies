Complearn is a system that makes use of data compression methodologies
for mining patterns in a large amount of data. So, it is basically a
compression-based machine learning system. For identifying and
learning different patterns, it provides a set of utilities which can
be used in applying standard compression mechanisms. The most
important characteristic of complearn is its power in mining patterns
even in domains that are unrelated. It has the ability to identify and
classify the language of different bodies of text [@www-complearn]. This
helps in reducing the work of providing background knowledge regarding
a particular classification. It provides such generalization through a
library that is written in ANSI C which is portable and works in many
environments [@www-complearn]. Complearn provides immediate to access
every core functionality in all the major languages as it is designed
to be extensible.
