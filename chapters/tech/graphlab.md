GraphLab is a graph-based parallel framework for C++, especially for machine 
learning. GraphLab originally is

> "an academic project at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a new parallel 
> computation abstraction tailored to machine learning"

Given the scale and complexity of real world data, the GraphLab has been 
designed by incorporating different high level algorithms for a higher 
performance [@fa18-423-05-www-analyticsvidhya]. With algorithms like Stochastic 
Gradient Descent incorporated, GraphLab can help create or install large scale 
applications in a convenient way. Furthermore, GraphLab comprises toolkits for 
machine learning, and neat libraries for data transformation, manipulation and 
model visualization.

SFrame, one of the data structures used in GraphLab, is a disk-based tabular 
data structure. It 

> "helps to scale analysis and data processing to handle large data set (Tera 
> byte), even on your laptop" [@fa18-423-05-www-analyticsvidhya].

Also, the SFrame syntax is similar to the widely-used library pandas. SFrame 
collect elements stored on disk and make then into SArray columns 
[@fa18-423-05-www-analyticsvidhya]. 

GraphLab is has free trial for 30 days or 1 year for academic edition.
