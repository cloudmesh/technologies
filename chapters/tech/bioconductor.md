Bioconductor is an open source and open development platform used for
analysis and understanding of high throughput genomic
data. Bioconductor is used to analyze DNA microarray, flow,
sequencing, SNP, and other biological data. All contributions to
Bioconductor are under an open source license. The goals of
Bioconductor

> ``include fostering collaborative development and widespread use of
> innovative software, reducing barriers to entry into
> interdisciplinary scientific research, and promoting the achievement
> of remote reproducibility of research results'' [@bioconductor-article-2004].

The Bioconductor is
primarily based on R, as most components of Bioconductor are released
in R packages [@www-bioconductor-about].  Extensive documentation
is provided for each Bioconductor package as vignettes, which include
task-oriented descriptions for the functionalities of each
package. Bioconductor has annotation functionality to associate


> ``genemoic data in real time with biological metadata from web
> databases such as GenBank, Entrez genes and PubMed.''

Bioconductor also has tools to process genomic annotation data.
