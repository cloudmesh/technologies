Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop SQL database built for massively parallel
processing.  The database offers advanced parallel processing combined
with machine learning tools and the scalability of Hadoop
[@fa18-523-84-hawq].  The architecture of Apache HAWQ aims to provide
low latency query responses that can scale to datasets as large as a
petabyte [@fa18-523-84-hawq].  This results a reduction of time needed
to explore large datasets and implement complex machine learning
models.  The improved query speed is also beneficial for consumer
applications that rely on learning models and big data.  Another
benefit of Apache HAWQ is its compatibility with SQL based
applications as the database is ANSI SQL compliant.  Business
Intelligence and data visualization tools are also compatible allowing
easy exploration of large datasets with increased speed.  The
compatibility and similarity allows a user to leverage familiar skills
to work with the database and achieve the desired results
[@fa18-523-84-hawq].

Apache HAWQ is native to Hadoop which allows for easy scaling of nodes
to handle capacity or performance requirements [@fa18-523-84-hawq]. The
tool also provides easy integration of Apache MADlib machine learning
libraries that can be used to work with data in Apache HAWQ.  As of
Aug 15, 2018 Apache HAWK was approved as a top level project for the
Apache Software Foundation [@fa18-523-84-hawq].  As momentum increases
new features and bug fixes are planned to be implemented in order to
improve the tool.

The project is continuing to move forward but in February of 2018 the
organization Pivotal decided to end the availability of HAWQ (Pivotal
HDB) [@fa18-523-84-end-of-life].  In the early design of HAWQ Pivotal
was a key player in the development through the creation of the
Pivotal Greenplum enterprise database [@fa18-523-84-hawq].  Now the
project will continue as an open source project.
