Programming with Big Data in R (pbdR) is an environment having series
of R packages for statistical computing with Big Data using
high-performance statistical computation [@www-pbdR]. It uses R, a
popular language between statisticians and data miners. *pbdR* focuses
on distributed memory system, where data is distributed accross
several machines and processed in batch mode. It uses MPI for inter
process communications. R focuses on single machines for data analysis
using a interactive GUI. Currently there are two implementation of
pbdR, one Rmpi and another being pdbMpi.  Rmpi uses SPMD parallelism
while pbdRMpi uses manager/worker parallelism.
