Google Kubernetes is a cluster management platform developed by
Google. Since 2014 Kubernetes has been open source and managed by The
Cloud Native Computing Foundation [@fa18-523-56-www-kubernetes.io].
Kubernetes is popular because of its flexibility and powerful
capabilities to meet the demands of modern cloud-based architecture.
Kubernetes is the result of efforts at Google to manage containers
with hallmarks of both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as
Service. Building Kubernetes, google engineers had some specific
goals;

> "... make it easy to deploy and manage complex distributed systems,
> while still benefiting from the improved utilization that containers
> enable" [@fa18-523-56-www-3google-containers-mgmt-sys].

So what is Kubernetes? In simple terms Kubernetes intended be the
central platform and managing entity for applications, tools and
workloads in any environment. Kubernetes is geared towards container
environments where workloads go up and down. Kubernetes can organize
and balance the connectivity, disk space and distributed computing in
a containerized infrastructure [@fa18-523-56-www-kubernetes.io].

Kubernetes is not limited to the cloud, but it seeks to be at the
forefront of cloud architecture. Flexibility and extensibility are key
Kubernetes hallmarks [@fa18-523-56-www-kubernetes-redhat]. The goal with
Kubernetes is to allow as many other solutions to be used in the 
infrastructure as possible. Kubernetes is intended to be extremely 
flexible. With this goal it doesn't dictate a CI or automation policy. 
It allows the user to build a container in a way that best serves the
organizations needs then provides the management tools to scale, 
manage, and maintain that complex cloud based applications or 
infrastructure [@fa18-523-56-www-kubernetes-redhat].

Kubernetes can be broken into two architectural buckets; the master
node and workers notes. Within the master node as you might expect one
of the key components is the API server [@fa18-523-56-www-Kubernetes-DesignArchitecture].
The API server controls the cluster and executes REST commands. Scheduled
jobs and activities are initiated from the API server via the scheduler. 
Outside of the master node are the worker nodes Pods are run in the worker 
nodes [@fa18-523-56-www-Kubernetes-DesignArchitecture].Pods are run on the same 
host and can contain a group of containers that work together. Pods share 
volumes and network connectivity and other resources. Kubelets receive from the 
API server configuration info for the pod.
