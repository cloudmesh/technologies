ArangoDB is a NoSQL database system used to support multiple data models
against a single backend engine. ArangoDB supports three main models
which are key-value pair, document and graph. Compared to MongoDB, which
is a document oriented database, ArangoDB has added benefits such as
scalability, lower operation costs, supporting JOINs and complex
transactions [@hid-sp18-416-www-arangodb]. ArangoDB used its' own query
language AQL, which is similar to SQL, but has the benefit of querying a
schema free database [@hid-sp18-416-www-aql-blog]. ArangoDB provides
flexibility in terms of querying the data because AQL can be used to
query across all supported data models. This ease of use in ArangoDB
allows developers to represent the components of their systems by models
that are much more suitable. This is the reason for the gain in
popularity for native multi-model databases such as ArangoDB
[@hid-sp18-416-www-graphdb-blog].
