A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally
facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a
contract without third parties which means there is no need for
*middlemen* like lawyers or notaries. In theory, this means that you can
carry out transactions without the waiting times inherent to paper
filings, and without paying fees to whoever would typically oversee such
a transaction. This is particularly important for people living in
countries where the legal system is corrupt, or woefully inefficient.
These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Although smart contract technology is still a very new, it has a wide
range of potential applications like as voting, global supply chains,
medical records, the financial system. It is very promising it is
believed that its full potential has yet to be discovered.

One application of Ethereum is the generation of Crypto currency. There
are still a lot of doubts regarding the usefulness of cryptocurrency. A
lot of people are still on the fence whether they Use cryptocurrency as
a real currency or not. However, the blockchain technology on which
Ethereum is running is a real technology that has a lot of practical
applications. Big companies and government institutions are investing in
the blockchain technology and Ethereum can play a major role in it.
