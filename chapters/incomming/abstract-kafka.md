Kafka is an open source distributed streaming platform that belongs to
the Apache Hadoop family. It is mainly used in data ingestion and
building real time data pipelines. Since Kafka is fault tolerant,
scalable and efficient it is in production today in thousands of
companies. Kafka also works as messaging system based on the
publisher-subscriber model where the publisher produces data and the
subscriber consumes the data. It can be compared to ActiveMQ in the
messaging space [@hid-sp18-517-ApacheKafka].The two main real-time
streaming applications of Kafka are, building data pipe-lines to
transport data between systems or applications, and building
applications that transform or react to stream of data. A few use cases
of Kafka are website activity tracking, messaging and log
aggregation [@hid-sp18-517-ApacheKafka].
