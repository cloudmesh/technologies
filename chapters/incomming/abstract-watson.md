IBM Watson is a super computer built on cognitive technology that
processes information like the way human brain does by understanding the
data in a natural language as well as analyzing structured and
unstructured data [@www-ibmwatson-wiki]. It was initially developed as a
question and answer tool more specifically to answer questions on the
quiz show \*Jeopardy\* but now it has been seen as helping doctors and
nurses in the treatment of cancer. It was developed by IBM's DeepQA
research team led by David Ferrucci. With Watson you can create bots
that can engage in conversation with you [@www-ibmwatson]. You can even
provide personalized recommendations to Watson by understanding a user's
personality, tone and emotion. Watson uses the Apache Hadoop framework
in order to process the large volume of data needed to generate an
answer by creating in-memory datasets used at run-time. Watson's DeepQA
UIMA s (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) annotators
were deployed as mappers in the Hadoop Map-Reduce framework. Watson is
written in multiple programming languages like Java, C++, Prolog and it
runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Today Watson is available as a
set of open source APIs and Software As a Service product as
well[@www-ibmwatson].

IBM's Watson computer, named after the company's first CEO, Thomas
Watson, was created to fulfill an engineering challenge: to defeated
Jeapordy! champions[@hid-sp18-525-watson]. Although Watson defeated for
champions, that victory was years in the making. Numerous adjustments
were required to make all 3 contestants equal. For example, Watson was
required to push a button, like the other
contestants[@hid-sp18-525-watson]. Since the early days of Watson, many
advances in computing have happened. The explosion of machine learning
algorithms and artificial intelligence have greatly expanded the use of
Watson. Watson has developed into a mar- keting slogan, and is even
co-branded with companies, such as H&R Block[@hid-sp18-525-watson].
Advancements in hardware enabled the revolution in data analysis that is
currently happening. Super computing, like Watson, along with enhanced
al- gorithms have fueled the revolution. Based on such advances, Watson
is now a stand-alone division at IBM[@hid-sp18-525-watson]. Being a
separate division and an individual brand gives IBM the ability to
deploy Watson to a myriad of activities. Watson is the hub of IBM's
cloud computing business. Watson also forecasts the weather and conducts
research from any number of organizations[@hid-sp18-525-watson].
