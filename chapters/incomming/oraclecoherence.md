Oracle Coherence is an In-Memory Data Grid, data management platform for
application objects that are shared across one or multiple distributed
servers that requires low response time, very high throughput,
predictable scalability, high availability and
reliability [@hid-sp18-514-OracleCoherence].

Initially this framework was developed by Tangosol. The Tangosol, was
acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2007 [@hid-sp18-514-coherencewiki] and
named that framework as Oracle Coherence.

Oracle coherence data grid platform used for computational intensive,
stateful middtle-tier applications that runs in a distributed platform.
Coherence is directed to run application layer, and is often run
in-memory with application itself. Oracle coherence Data Grid is a
system of composed of multiple servers that work to manage information
and related operations. Coherence provides the ideal infrastructure for
building Data Grid services, and the client and server-based
applications that use a Data Grid. At a basic level, Coherence can
manage an huge amount of data across a large number of servers in a
grid; it can provide minimal or low latency access for that data; it
supports parallel queries to access the data with high throughput.
Coherence also supports integration with database and EIS systems that
act as the system of record for that data. Additionally, Coherence
provides other services that are ideal for building more effective data
grids [@hid-sp18-514-OracleCoherence].

This framework comes by default with Oracle WebLogic 12c server. Oracle
also provides standalone coherence server, which can be used in any Big
Data environment to store any database data, inflight or any dataset to
be processed by MapReduce or any other Hadoop component. Cache servers
can be configured in the clusters. This framework can be used in the Big
Data environment without HDFS for in-memory distributed data storage.
There are DOT NET, JAVA, C++ and other API's available along with REST
service to access Coherence cache [@hid-sp18-514-OracleCoherence].
Oracle coherence can be integrated from Spring based distributed
applications as well [@hid-sp18-514-CoherenceSpringInt].
