The world bank is a philanthropic organization that has two main goals.
First, end extreme poverty and second, to promote shared prosperity. One
of the ways the World Bank hopes to meet its goals is by developing and
sharing an open-data platform that can be used by the public. The World
Bank hopes the open data platform can be used to promote knowledge that
will ultimately help with its goal of promoting prosperity and ending
extreme poverty [@hid-sp18-505-Bank2018].
