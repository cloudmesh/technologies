RabbitMQ technology is open source message broker, which supports multiple 
messaging protocols. It has many features such as asynchronous messaging, 
which supports message queuing, receive and deliver acknowledgments, 
routing any message queues with broadcasting to logs or messages to 
multiple users [@hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQ].

On the collection of nodes which is also known as clusters, Users 
shares the many resources among several nodes, where RabbitMQ applications 
are running and host them virtually, with managing queues and maintain 
runtime parameters [@hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQCluster].

Several authentication mechanisms are been implemented and can be 
customized with RabbitMQ including SASL. By default, authentication in
RabbitMQ is very PLAIN and requires setup on respective servers and clients 
[@hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQauth]. With the advancement of the technology which 
was earlier implemented as Advance Message Queuing and now it been enhanced 
for supporting streaming Text oriented messaging protocol. There are many 
other protocols have been developed to improve the technology 
[@hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQwiki].

A browser UI based API is provided for monitoring and managing RabbitMQ 
servers. The admins can use this API for addressing and any kind of updates 
needed to provide better services [@hid-sp18-520-RabbitMQmana].
