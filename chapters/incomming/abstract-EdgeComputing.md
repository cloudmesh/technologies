Edge computing is a network architecture concept where in the cloud
computing capabilities are carried out at the edge of cellular network
where the end device or requester is located.

The main idea behind edge computing is to reduce the network latency and
radio network resource consumption by bringing the cloud services closer
to the device so that latency is reduced significantly.

This mechanism requires leveraging or using resources that may not be
connected to a network with devices such as laptops, smartphones,
tablets and sensors.

Majority of its application are realized in IOT and other smart
connected ecosystem where emergency is the highest priority and data
processing is scarce.

Naive example would be a baby crossing a road and
an autonous vehicle running over the same road, needs to decide as soon
as possible to stop motion in order to save baby's life. It cannot send
the data to main cloud server and wait for response which would be time
consuming and baby's life would be at jeopardy. Hence edge computing
would be really useful and saviour for scenarios where offloading to
cloud is considered costly.
