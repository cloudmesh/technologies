> ``H20 is a open source platform that can execute highly advanced and
> complex machine learning algorithms in faster and scalable
> way,regardless of the size, format and location of the
> data'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o].



> ``It achieves this by serializing the data faster between nodes and
> clusters that stores huge amount of data. Data processing is done in
> memory thus providing faster response'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o].



> ``It uses fine grain parallelism technique for processing of
> distributed data archiving 100x faster speed as compared to
> traditional mapreduce without compromising on
> accuracy'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o].
