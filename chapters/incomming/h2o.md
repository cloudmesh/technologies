H2O is an open source platform. It can execute highly advanced and complex
machine learning algorithms in faster and scalable way. Complex models running 
on H2O platform give results faster regardless of size, format and place of data. 
H2O serializes large amount of data stored in nodes and clusters rapidly.
 Data processing is done in memory thus providing 
faster response [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o].

It uses fine grain parallelism technique for processing of distributed data. 
This helps H2O achieve 100 times faster speed as compared to traditional
 mapreduce. H2O4GPU, Sparkling Water and Driverless AI are some
popular H2O products. H2O4GPU enables usage of high performance GPUs while 
running complex machine learning algorithm. Sparking Water enables usage of 
Spark in transformation and mapping of data. And, Driverless AI is an automated 
machine learning platform to create artificial intelligence products 
and services[@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o]. 

H2O platform is being used for machine learning and AI related research across 
industries. Cisco, PayPal, Comcast, Macy and Booking.com are some of the 
companies that uses H2O platform[@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o]. 
H2O offers web based GUI workflow for creating machine learning models. 
Machine learning pipeline steps can be easily created in GUI workflow using 
drag and drop components. H2O platform supports mutiple languages.
Developers can write machine learning code in their preferred progamming 
languages such as python , scala, Java, R etc.
