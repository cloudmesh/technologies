Apache Metron is yet another open source project that serves as a big
data solution for CyberSecurity applications. It provides a framework to
ingest, process and also store data such as application logs, network
logs and so on so that can be analyzed by Information security teams so
that they can detect anomalies and respond to cyber threats. It provides
the storage solution in the form of security data lake or vault where
the logs can be stored long term on cost effective storage. In addition
to SIEM or Security information and event management features Metron
also provides packet replay utilities which can be of immense help for
the security analysts. Metron also support applying machine learning
algorithms on real time data that is being ingested through continuous
streams [@hid-sp18-517-metron-apache]. Apache Metron caters to
personnels at all levels in the CyberSecurity operations from CISO to
SOC analyst to security Data
Scientist [@hid-sp18-517-metron-hortonworks]. It provides a single view
of the risk to CISO or Chief Information Security Officer while
automatically performs that analytics so security investigator does not
have to spend time on finding co-relation in the data. Metron also has
the capability to create incidents and can integrate with the ITSM or
