Firepad is an open source real-time collaborative code and text editing
cloud platform found by Google in 2016 and licensed under
MIT [@hid-sp18-409-www-firepad]. It is mostly used for rich text editing
and code editing as it is empowered with true collaborative editing and
intelligent operational transform-based merging and conflict
resolution [@hid-sp18-409-www-firepad-wikipedia]. Some important
features included in the Firepad are cursor position synchronization,
undo and redo, text highlighting, user attribution, presence detection
and version check-pointing. As Michael
Lehenbauer [@hid-sp18-409-www-firepad], the founder of Firepad claims
that it has no server dependencies and yet provide real-time data
synchronization using the Firebase realtime database technology. It is
easy to integrate Firepad to any application since inclusion of few
JavaScript files would enable the Firepad in all modern browsers such as
Chrome, Safari, Opera 11+, IE8+ and Firefox 3.6+

Nitrous.IO, LiveMinutes, Koding, CoderPad.io and ShiftEdit are few
