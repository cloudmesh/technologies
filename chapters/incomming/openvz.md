OpenVZ is a container-based virtualization for Linux [@www-openvz].
OpenVZ is mainly composed of three parts: the kernel, an set of tools
and operating system templates.

OpenVZ applies to many places, including server consolidation, hosting,
development and testing, security and education [@www-openvz-intro]. If
you have a lot of Linux servers that are not being fully utilized,
OpenVZ can be used to integrate them into a few (or possibly one)
physical machines. However, OpenVZ is completely command-oriented and
currently does not include any GUI-based applications. It may not be
suitable for those who are afraid of a shell prompt.
