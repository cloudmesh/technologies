Google Genomics is an extension to Google cloud platform.
 It helps life science community organize genomics information and 
make it available for research. Researchers are able to apply Google 
powerful technologies such as Google Search and Maps on genomics data.
 Google Genomics allows users to securely store, process and share 
complex genomics datasets. Multiple genome repositories 
data can be processed using Google Genomics within seconds. It is 
backed by high performance Google bigtable and Spanner 
technologies [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics]. 

Google Genomics is based on open standard from Global Alliance of Genomics 
and health. These open standards help in achieving high level of 
interoperability. It is fully integrated with Google cloud virtual machine, 
storage and databases. It helps analyze Genomic data 
in real-time with BigQuery. Users can analyze worldwide genomics 
data using their prefered language such as R, Python, Java etc through API.
 Data can be accessed and processed in transactional or batch mode.
 Users can use Genome Analysis Toolkit for analyzing Genomics data in batch 
 mode. Apache spark or grid cluster may be used for faster processing of
large and complex genome datasets. Organizations can use this platform 
for increasing their revenue. They can monetize their proprietary genomics 
data by hosting on Google Cloud and billing their clients 
on usage basis[@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].
