PyTorch is known as Python based scientific computation package, built to 
support deep learning researches and neural network models. PyTorch has 
many packages which are used for deep learning, multi processing, loading 
data. It is fast and has high computation speed when running with any size 
of datasets [@hid-sp18-520-PyTorch]. PyTorch uses Tensors for building 
computation and are very similar to Numpy arrays.It uses the GPUs for  
computation and responsible for faster retrieval of the data or results 
which are required for neural network model. There are many variables provided 
by PyTorch for executing Tensor and respective gradients. It provides 
an provision for computational graphs which helps significatnly during the 
debugging of the code or visualizing any results from any computations 
step by step [@hid-sp18-520-PyTorchgrad].
There are many modules defined within PyTorch, some of them are like nn 
Module, which is acting as neural network layers producing outputs with 
weights details. Autograd module, which captures and helps calculating 
derivatives and gradients. With Optim module, which are helpful when 
implementing the optimized model for neural network models creation and 
implementation [@hid-sp18-520-PyTorchtensor].
