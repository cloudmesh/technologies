PyTorch is known as Python based scientific computation package, built to 
support Deep learning researches and Neural network models. PyTorch has 
packages which are used for deep learning, multi processing, loading 
data for processing into the models. It is fast and has high computation 
speed when run with any size of datasets [@hid-sp18-520-PyTorch]. 

PyTorch uses Tensors for building computation and are very similar to
Numpy arrays. It uses the GPUs for its computation and responsible for 
faster retrieval of the data or results which are required for neural 
network. There are many variable provided by PyTorch which detail on 
Tensor and its gradient. It provides provision for computational graphs 
which helps a lot during the debugging of the code or viewing any results 
from any computations step by step [@hid-sp18-520-PyTorchgrad].

There are many modules defined in PyTorch, such as nn Module, which is 
acting as neural network layers producing outputs with 
weights details. Autograd module, which captures and helps calculating 
derivatives and gradients. With Optim module, which are very helpful when 
implementing the optimized model for neural network models creation 
[@hid-sp18-520-PyTorchtensor].
