Rackspace is a cloud computing company which administrates cloud system

managing the business growth of their partners. Rackspace differentiates
itself from other companies by stating that the cloud system alone which
is provided by other companies are not sufficient to operate the
infrastructure efficiently.

Rackspace proudly states that it takes several innovative and cognitive
engineering skills to develop and manage the infrastructure and also
concentrating on tools and applications which are necessary to
administrate. BY providing all such toolwith updated data engines and
e-commerce platforms, Rackspace claims that it will manage cloud and
infrastructure of their business partners in a much different and
efficient way [@hid-sp18-406-Rackspace].
