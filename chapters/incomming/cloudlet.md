A cloudlet is technique or mechanism by which the cloud capabilities and
its wonderful storage,data processing and data analysis power is brought
at the edge of the cellular network. The main idea behind cloudlet is to
bring the cloud and its services closer to the client (IOT devices,smart
phones, smart watches) which cannot independently complete the high load
of computation and would require offloadingto meet the computational
requirements. This offloading to the main cloud serverwould take
relatively longer time in cases where the action has to be taken as
soonas possible in real time. Thus in scenarios where latency must be
minimum and offloading becomes compulsory we would then be compelled to
use cloudlets, where the computation now happens at the edge of cellular
network and latency is reduced significantly.

Thus a cloudlet can be viewed as a mini data center whose aim is to
bring the cloud closer to the Non powerful devices.
