Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform
that helps you release software updates with high velocity and
confidence. It provides two core features: cluster management to view
and manage your resources in the cloud and deployment management to
construct and manage continuous delivery
workflows [@hid-sp18-602-www-spinnaker-io]. The main advantage of
Spinnaker is it holds a modern software development concept of
continuous delivery that is application updates should be delivered when
they are ready, instead of on a fixed schedule. Also, it improves the
speed, stability of application deployment processes along with
supporting deployments across different platforms by several different
cloud providers.

Although the project Spinnaker first started out with Netflix and then
google joined in 2014, the Spinnaker community now includes dozens of
organizations such as Microsoft, Oracle, Target, Veritas, Schibsted,
Armory and Kenzan [@hid-sp18-602-www-spinnaker-gc].
