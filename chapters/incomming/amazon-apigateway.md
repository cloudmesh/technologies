The AWS API Gateway [@hid-sp18-518-AWS-APIGateway] is used to manage
multiple RESTful services in a defined way. You can set up the API
Gateway using the CLI, CloudFormation or even Swagger templates. The API
Gateway is serverless and AWS will manage all of the underlying
infrastructure for you. The design allows you to configure the API
mapping and integrations. The API Gateway can then help you define
authentication/authorization controls, define the lifecycle for the
services and even track transactions for uses like billing.
