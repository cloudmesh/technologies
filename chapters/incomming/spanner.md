Cloud Spanner is cloud based service for globally distributed database.
It can grow horizontally and exponentially. Most data for business 
systems is stored in relational databases. There was need to bridge 
gap between relational and non relational database that 
provide high performance and availability. Cloud Spanner bridges this 
gap. This technology combines benefits of relational database structure 
such as atomicity, consistency, isolation, durablity with non-relational 
databases that can scale horizontally. This is unique combination that 
allows transactions to be executed with high performance and greater 
consistency. Cloud Spanner revolutionizes database administration, 
management and makes application development more efficient. It is fully 
managed, can be easily deployed and comes with out of the box synchronous 
and replication functionality[@hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner]. 

It takes advantages of all critical features of relational database such 
as schemas, ACID transactions, and SQL queries. It reduces
need of high learning curve for developers who are well proficient in 
structured query language. Client libraries that can connect to spanner is 
language independent. These libraries can be developed in C sharp, Go, Java, 
Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Already existing JDBC driver with popular 
third-party tools can be used to connect with Google
spanner[@hid-sp18-523-www-google-spanner]. 
It is purposely built for global transactional consistency.
