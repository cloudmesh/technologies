Google BigQuery is a cloud-based big data analytics web service for
processing very large read-only data sets. BigQuery can analyze data on
the order of billions of rows, using a SQL-like syntax. It runs on the
Google Cloud Storage infrastructure and can be accessed with a
REST-oriented application program interface
(API) [@hid-sp18-501-TechTarget].

BigQuery enables the creation of a logical data warehouse over managed,
columnar storage as well as data from object storage, and spreadsheets.
It also allows the capture and analysis of data in real-time using its
powerful streaming ingestion [@hid-sp18-501-GoogleCP_BQ].
