Google BigQuery is a cloud-based big data analytics web service for
processing very large read-only data sets. BigQuery can analyze data on
the order of billions of rows, using a SQL-like syntax. It runs on the
Google Cloud Storage infrastructure and can be accessed with a
REST-oriented application program interface
(API) [@hid-sp18-501-TechTarget].

BigQuery enables the creation of a logical data warehouse over managed,
columnar storage as well as data from object storage, and spreadsheets.
It also allows the capture and analysis of data in real-time using its
powerful streaming ingestion [@hid-sp18-501-GoogleCP_BQ].

mgm3IUâ€™s summary review (Mark Miller, FA18-523-63):

Google BigQuery is intended as a data warehouse that streamlines access to large datasets without the need of the complicated intricacies that require DBAs. It is a RESTful information gathering tool that can use functionality that is similar to a SQL database. Because it is a Google product, it does require Google storage which allows it the benefit. Data is managed in a JSON form, allowing for powerful parser tools/libraries to be utilized in analysis.

This tool is effective for data analysts/experts who wish to use data that is highly scalable and require familiar functionality. Because it uses a SQL-like query language, on top of Google Storage, with all of its proprietary scripts and other analytics tools, it can be a cost-effective way for a small or large company to perform deep learning applications in simplified VDI and other company infrastructures.

One valuable feature is that separated compute and storage resources are available. This enables the use of cloud and other big data analytics by not requiring the storage of all data that is processed. This causes Google BigQuery to be the leader in a cause that all big data analysts require for their detailed analytics.

Further features of the BigQuery tool include high data availability, real-time analytics/usage, local storage for foreign companies, governance for data integrity, and artificial/business intelligence and machine learning libraries. It also includes other management tools such as Cost Controls and inventory/management consoles. There are many public datasets that can be used along with other proprietary options to further the cause of any customer using this product. Its management is synchronous with processing which promotes comfort with the health status of the data in question. As the storage is managed off-site, Google technicians are able to troubleshoot quickly with expertise that is otherwise unfound in big data storage and implementations.
