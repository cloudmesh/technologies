AWS Greengrass [@hid-sp18-521-Greengrass] is a product that allows a
developer to create serverless code residing on AWS that can then be run
locally on your devices. Those devices are then able to act locally on
the data it creates while being able to utilize the cloud for handling
the infrastructure. Devices can still communicate with each other even
when unable to connect to the Internet. Filters can also be added
locally to each device allowing the user to be able to control what data
is being sent back to the cloud. It can help users create IoT solutions
which allow connectivity between many different types of devices and the
cloud simultaneously. Greengrass supports many different programming
languages. One of its core features is machine learning inference, which
allows a device to directly perform inference, or applying an already
trained and optimized model to new data, before sending the
appropriately filtered data back to the cloud.
