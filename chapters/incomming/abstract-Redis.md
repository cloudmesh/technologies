> ``Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure
> store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports
> data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets
> with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes
> with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting,
> LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk
> persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and
> automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster. It can run atomic
> operations on these types, like appending to a string, incrementing
> the value in a hash; pushing an element to a list; computing set
> intersection, union and difference, or getting the member with
> highest ranking in a sorted set. In order to achieve its outstanding
> performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on
> your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to
> disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a
> log. Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave asynchronous
> replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization,
> auto-reconnection with partial resynchronization on net
> split'' [@hid-sp18-520-Redis].
