Hyperledger Sawtooth is an open source, blockchain platform which can be
used to build distributed ledger applications. It is main application is
to simplify the development of blockchain applications by isolating the
core system from the application domain.

> ``This allows for developers to quickly and easily develop and
> deploy applications with custom tailored business rules in some of
> the more common languages'' [@hid-sp18-414-Hyperledger_Sawtooth].



Some of the core features that make Hyperledger Sawtooth a unique and
interesting distributed ledger technology:



> ``On-chain governance - Utilize smart contracts to vote on
> blockchain configuration settings such as the allowed participants
> and smart contracts. Advanced transaction execution engine - Process
> transactions in parallel to accelerate block creation and
> validation. Support for Ethereum - Run solidity smart contracts and
> integrate with Ethereum tooling. Dynamic consensus - Upgrade or swap
> the blockchain consensus protocol on the fly as your network grows,
> enabling the integration of more scalable algorithms as they are
> available. Broad language support - Program smart contracts in your
> preferred language, with support including Go, JavaScript, Python
> and more.'' [@hid-sp18-414-Linux_Foundation_Sawtooth]
