Google App Engine, generally called App Engine is a Platform as a
service cloud solution (PaaS). It lets you build and run applications on
Google's cloud infrastructure. In this platform the developer does not
have to worry about infrastructure such as database administration,
server configurations and load balancing which is done by google.
Developers only job is to develop source codes. It claims to be highly
scalable as it can automatically increases capacity depending upon the
workloads [@hid-sp18-415-www-scalabitity].

Applications in App Engine can be run in either Flexible or Standard
Environment or both can be used at the same
time [@hid-sp18-415-www-cloud-goggle]. Automatic scaling of apps, user
customization of runtime (Eclipse Jetty 9, Python 2.7 and Python 3.6,
Node.js, Ruby, PHP, `.NET` core, and Go), operating system and even CPU
memory are some of the features of App Engine Flexible
environment [@hid-sp18-415-www-cloud-goggle]. Applications in Flexible
environment run in Docker containers on Google Compute virtual machines.
While in App Engine Standard Environment application instances are run
in sandbox with prespecified runtime environment of supported language
(Python 2.7, Java 7, Java 8, PHP 5.5 and GO 1.8,
1.6) [@hid-sp18-415-app-engine]. This means if source code uses Python
then its instances are run in Python runtime.
