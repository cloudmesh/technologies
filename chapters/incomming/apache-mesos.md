Apache Mesos is the distributed systems kernel built similarly to the
Linux kernel, but runs on a different level [@hid-sp18-404-Apache2018].
Apache Mesos performs container and support and massively scalable data
support by splitting scheduling into a two-level architecture.
Applications running on Mesos are containerized separately from the
framework handling infrastructure scheduling
operations [@hid-sp18-404-Mesos2018].
