Apache PredictionIO is an open source machine learning stack for
building, evaluating and deploying engines with machine learning
algorithms. An open source Machine Learning Server built on top of an
open source stack allows developers and data scientists to create
predictive engines for any machine learning task. It allows developers
to quickly build and deploy an engine as a web service and unify data
from multiple platforms in batch or in real-time for comprehensive
predictive analytics. It supports machine learning and data processing
libraries such as Spark MLLib and OpenNLP [@hid-sp18-510-web-PredIO].
