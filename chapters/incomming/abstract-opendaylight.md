OpenDaylight is an open source Software Defined Networks (SDN)
controller[@hid-sp18-419-www-opendaylight]. SDN separates network
control logic from physical networking equipment. The result is that
networking equipment is programmable like other computing platforms. SDN
facilitates Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), allowing virtual
network services (switching, virtualized appliances, and virtualized
applications) to be deployed without having to deploy specialized
physical devices[@hid-sp18-419-www-cio-sdn-nfv]. The OpenDaylight
project was founded by a group of large tech companies, including Cisco,
Citrix, Ericsson, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, Red Hat, and VMware.
Microsoft and VMware have since left the
project[@hid-sp18-419-www-sdx-odl].
