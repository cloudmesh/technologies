Neptune is a graph database service that was announced at the AWS
Re:INVENT conference in November of 2017 [@hid-sp18-419-www-tc_neptune].
Graph databases are NoSQL databases that used graph structures to
organize data [@hid-sp18-419-www-tp-graph-db]. They are commonly used
for social networking applications, but can be used for recommendation
engines, logistics, and other applications. Amazon offers Neptune as a
fully managed product. It supports Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL
open source graph APIs. One can choose Gremlin or the W3C standard
Resource Description Framework model [@hid-sp18-419-www-aws-neptune].
