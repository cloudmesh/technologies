MongoDB is document database that belongs to the NoSQL family of
databases. MongoDB is free and open-source, published under the GNU
Affero General Public License. It is known for its scalability and
flexibility. MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.
MongoDB's HA features include automatic failover and data redundancy,
this is achieved using replica set, which is nothing but group of
MongoDB servers that maintain the same data. MongoDB supports sharding
by distributing the data across the cluster of
machines [@hid-sp18-517-MongoDB-intro].
