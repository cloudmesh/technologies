The AWS Foundation Benchmarks [@hid-sp18-518-FoundationBenchmarks]
project is a repository of Python scripts that can be used to evaluate
your AWS account and it's configuration. The project is intended to be
integrated into your CloudFormation stack so that it can run the
benchmarks on every iteration of your code pipeline. The benchmarks are
sourced from the Center of Internet Security and it can help you find
issues in your IAM, your VPC configuration, your S3 bucket permissions
and many other places that are commonly left open by default or
accident.
