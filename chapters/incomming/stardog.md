Stardog is a graph database from US-software company Complexible.
Stardog has a particular focus on OWL and RDF-based systems, with the
latest release Stardog 5.2 (9 January 2018) supports SPARQL query
language; property graph model and Gremlin graph traversal language; OWL
2 and user-defined rules for inference and data analytics; virtual
graphs; geospatial query answering; and programmatic interaction via
several languages and network
interfaces [@hid-sp18-405-wwwdocs-stardog]. Further, the developers of
StarDog OWL/RDF DBMS have pioneered a new use of OWL as a schema
language for RDF databases. This is achieved by adding integrity
constraints (IC), also expressed in OWL syntax, to the traditional
*open-world* OWL axioms [@hid-sp18-405-cer2012graphical-stardog]. Other
key features of Stardog include Machine Learning and Logical Inference,
Semantic Search, Geospatial Search etc. As a commercial software,
Stardog is priced for community, developer and enterprise tiers. The
enterprise version has a free 30-day trial and the community version is
free to download and use for up to four users and ten graph
databases [@hid-sp18-405-www-stardog].
