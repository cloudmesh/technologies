JavaScript is a ubiquitous programming language with an enormous number
of uses. It is best known as the language used to createweb
pages[@hid-sp18-525-java]. However, its uses are far more than would
appear. JavaScript is a flexible language that can function as object
oriented, as well as procedural[@hid-sp18-525-java]. JavaScript has had
a storied past[@hid-sp18-525-java]. Because of the universal adoption of
JavaScript, it has a bright future. JavaScript is not confined to
rendering web content. As an object-oriented language, JavaScript has
unlimited potential as a programming platform[@hid-sp18-525-java].
