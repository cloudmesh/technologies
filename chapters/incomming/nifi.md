Apache NiFi, which is short for NiagaraFiles, is a open source software
project from the Apache Software Foundation designed to automate the
flow of data between software systems [@hid-sp18-405-wiki-nifi]. Based
on the *NiagaraFiles* software previously developed by the NSA, Apache
NiFi is part of its technology transfer program in
2014 [@hid-sp18-405-wiki-nifi]. NiFi executes within a Java Virtual
Machine with the following primary components: Web Server, Flow
Controller, Extensions, FlowFile Repository, Content Repository and
Provenance Repository. Since NiFi's fundamental design concepts are
closely related to Flow Based Programming (FBP), some of the above
components can be mapped closely to FBP terms. For example, Flow
Controller and FlowFile can be related to Scheduler and Information
Packet in FBP terms
respectively [@hid-sp18-405-wwwoverview-nifi] [@hid-sp18-405-wikifbp-nifi].
Apache NiFi supports scalable directed graphs of data routing,
transformation, and system mediation logic, aiming at leveraging the
capabilities of the underlying host system on which it is operating,
especially with regard to CPU and disk [@hid-sp18-405-wwwoverview-nifi].
Some of the high-level capabilities and objectives of Apache NiFi
include: Web-based user interface, Highly configurable, Data Provenance,
Designed for extension and Secure [@hid-sp18-405-www-nifi].
