A Google Summer of Code project, scikit-learn project is a
machine-learning library. Written in Python, it is designed to be simple
and efficient, accessible to non-experts, and reusable in various
contexts. Its goal is to provide a set of common algorithms to Python
users through a consistent interface.

This package focuses on bringing m achine learning to non-specialists
using a general-purpose high-level language that is easy tofollow.

> academic and commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and
> documentation can be downloaded from
> http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net''  [@hid-sp18-506-Scikit-learn].



Although the library is easy to use its sophisticationand power to
analyze big data is never lost. This library has earned respect not only
in the academe but also in the industry. There are increasing demand in
the job market for scientist and engineers who specialize in this
library. The author himself has personally used this library and can
attest to its functionality. It has simplified a lot of usage of
algorithms but it still is a powerful tool.
