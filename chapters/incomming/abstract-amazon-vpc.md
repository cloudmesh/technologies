A VPC is part of the AWS infrastructure that is logically isolated and
spans a whole entire region of AWS to which the instances were created.

It provides the
possibility of assigning specific IP addresses, subnets, and network
rules when establishing communication with other resources within and
out of the infrastructure. This way, the traffic between instances of
the elastic cloud compute is protected against network intrusion. This
service makes it possible to separate public networks from private
providing business enterprises the power to decide which instances can
be exposed to the outside word and which cannot. VPC's include six major
components that are part of the default VPC. These include gateways,
Route Tables, Security Groups, Network Access Lists, and the Classless
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Blocks. These resources bring out the
simplicity, advanced security, and all the scalability and reliability
of AWS [@hid-sp18-512-amazon-vpc]
