Clojure [@hid-sp18-413-clojure] is a fully functional scripting
language. Although it is a complied programming language, all its
features are available at runtime. Clojure is based on
Lisp [@hid-sp18-413-lisp] and uses the same eco system. It provides
access to Java framework including hints and type inference. Clojure's
main advantage is its implementation of multithreaded
programming.Clojure very efficiently breaks a task into subtasks and
places them on different JVM threads for parallel processing. Parallel
programming has three challenges called three goblins; reference cells,
mutual exclusion and dwarves berserkers and Clojure handles them by
implementing three tools called futures, delays and promises.
