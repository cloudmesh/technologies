Apache Kudu was designed to fit into the Hadoop ecosystem and it serves
as the storage layer that enables fast analytics on fast
data [@hid-sp18-517-ApacheKudu].

Kudu internally follows the columnar storage approach rather than
storing data in rows. This columnar approach helps in efficient encoding
and compression. Kudu serves as a good alternative to HDFS and Apache
HBase. It works best especially with use cases that require fast
analytics on fast data. It is also efficient and designed to take
advantage of next generation hardware and in-memory
processing [@hid-sp18-517-ApacheKudu].
