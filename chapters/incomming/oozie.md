Apache Oozie is a workflow scheduler to manage Hadoop jobs. Workflows
are defined as a collection of control flow and action nodes in a
directed acyclic graph. Oozie jobs can either be triggered based on the
frequency or based on when the data becomes available. Oozie is
integrated with the Hadoop stack supporting several types of Hadoop jobs
such as map-reduce, Pig, Hive, Sqoop, Java programs and shell scripts.
Oozie is an Open Source Java Web-Application available under Apache
license 2.0. Oozie is a scalable, reliable and extensible system. It is
responsible for triggering the workflow actions, which in turn uses the
Hadoop execution engine to actually execute the task. Hence,Oozie is
able to leverage the existing Hadoop machinery for load balancing,
fail-over, etc [@hid-sp18-513-oozie].
