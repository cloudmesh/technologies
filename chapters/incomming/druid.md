Druid is a high-performance, column-oriented, distributed datastore
written in Java. Druid can be used to analyze large volumes of real time
streaming data as well as historic data. Druid is horizontally scalable
in a cost effective manner and also has the ability to support
multi-tenant applications [@hid-sp18-416-www-druid-wikipedia]. In
addition to the above mentioned key features Druid also includes the
capability to execute fast Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) queries
and is fault-tolerant in nature [@hid-sp18-416-www-about-druid]. The
Druid cluster is built from components such as Druid segments,
historical nodes, coordinator nodes and broker nodes. Druid also has
been identified as a very fast analytics database for fast real-time
applications [@hid-sp18-416-www-fast-dataanalytics-druid-blog].
