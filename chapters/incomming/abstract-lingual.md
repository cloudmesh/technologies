Lingual is a free, open source project designed to build Big Data
applications on Apache Hadoop [@hid-sp18-516-www-drivenio-lingual]. All
dependencies are installed through Maven [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-maven],
thereby allowing the developers to focus on simply creating the
applications which makes this tool easy to
use [@hid-sp18-516-www-cascading]. Lingual leverages the platform
support of *Cascading* [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-cascading], a stand-alone
open source Java application framework used for building data-intensive,
enterprise Big Data applications and frameworks on
Hadoop [@hid-sp18-516-www-drivenio-lingual]. Whether on-premise or in
the cloud, Lingual is compatible with all major distributions of
Hadoop [@hid-sp18-516-www-drivenio-lingual]. Its ANSI-standard
SQL [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-sql] interface allows SQL users to utilize
their existing SQL skills to access data locked on the
Hadoop [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-hadoop] clusters, thereby allowing them
to create Big data applications instantly without undergoing any new
training [@hid-sp18-516-www-drivenio-lingual]. It also provides a
JDBC [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-jdbc] driver, that can be integrated with
many existing BI tools and application
servers [@hid-sp18-516-www-cascading]. Being ANSI-SQL compliant, Lingual
enables companies to query and export data from Hadoop directly into
traditional BI tools [@hid-sp18-516-www-cascading]. Lingual also
provides other features like a SQL shell which is an interactive SQL
command interface to interact with Hadoop and a Catalog to map the
database tables into Hadoop files and
resources [@hid-sp18-516-www-cascading]. The ability to migrate
workloads on to Hadoop either through Cascading applications or with the
use of legacy SQL statements, significantly reduces the computing
costs [@hid-sp18-516-www-cascading]. Due to it's ease of creating
applications using SQL, JDBC or traditional BI tools, it overcomes the
barriers of integrating Hadoop with the existing data management systems
enabling fast and simple Big Data application development on Apache
Hadoop [@hid-sp18-516-www-drivenio-lingual].
