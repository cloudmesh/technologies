Keras is used in deep learning community to build neural nets with easy
to use syntax. There are other technologies/software packages like
TensorFlow, Pytorch which are also used to build neural networks, but
the syntax and documentation is long and difficult for a beginner in
deep learning community. Keras kind of acts as a wrapper around
TensorFlow with easy to use syntax but not compromising on different
tools/options within building neural network.

Using Keras, we can build normal Dense ANNs, Convolutional Neural Nets,
Optimize our neural network by specifying loss function and optimization
method, do regularization of neural network with techniques such as
dropout, etc..
