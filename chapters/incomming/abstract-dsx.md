IBM has compiled data science tools in one location, called Data Science
Experience. This one location provides access to the IBM Cloud, and
allows a customer to run applications from the public or private cloud 
[@hid-sp18-525-dsx]. Data Science Experience also allows desktop
operations of popular tools[@hid-sp18-525-dsx]. IBM's Watson computing
platform is available in Data Science Experience. Machine learning
models through Watson utilizing its vast computing resources.
Additionally, open source applications and technologies, such as Python,
R, and Apache Spark give users a robust data science toolkit from which
to work [@hid-sp18-525-dsx]. Every aspect of data science is available in
Data Science Experience. Visualizations of results are a part of Data
Science Experience. Tools such as PixieDust and Brunel are available,
without programming experience [@hid-sp18-525-dsx].
