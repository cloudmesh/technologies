Logicalglue [@hid-sp18-413-logicalglue] is a predictive analystics
software that is mostly targeted towards insurance sector. It employs
fuzzy logic to generate rules which in turn derive accurate
predictions.Logical glue helps in identifying which data is predictive
and can be deployed in cloud. It has its API which an be integrated into
buisnnes's already existing softwares. Logcalglue employs machine
learning and genetic algorithms to generate outcomes. New and dynamic
data can be fed to the model generated and analysis can be run in
realtime. This model accurately works on complete lifecycle of a project
right from customers acquisition to closure.
