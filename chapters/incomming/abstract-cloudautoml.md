Cloud AutoML
------------

Cloud AutoML is an innovative tool with simple graphical user interface
to train and test users custom machine learning
models [@hid-sp18-602-www-cloudautoml-main]. And these models can be
directly used from Google cloud via REST API.

The main purpose of developing Cloud AutoML is to enable users with
limited machine learning expertise to train high quality ML models. It
is built on Google learning to learn, transfer learning, and Neural
Architecture Search technologies.

Google has recently launched first product under Cloud AutoML: AutoML
Vision which is a service to access a pre-trained model or create a
custom ML models using Cloud ML Engine, for image recognition. It offers
drag-and-drop interface to upload images, train and manage models, and
then deploy those trained models directly on Google Cloud. For instance,
Disney and Zoological Society of London are actively using AutoML
Vision [@hid-sp18-602-wwww-cloudautoml-blog].
