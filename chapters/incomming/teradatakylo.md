Kylo is a data lake management software management platform. It is open
source and provides features like data ingestion with data clensing and
validation, metadata management, governance and security.

It can connect to many data sources and infer the schema from the common
available data formats. Kylo's data inegestion workflow transfers data
from source to Hive tables with various configuration options which are
built around validation of data fields, protection of data, data
profiling, data security and overall governance.

Kylo includes a metadata repository and provides key capabilities for
data exploration. Using this feature, users can search in data and
metadata to explore their entities of interest to gain insights.

By utilizing Kylo's capabilities, designers can develop new pipeline
templates in Apache Nifi. Kylo and Nifi can communicate between each
other to handle tasks between the cluster and the data center. The
combination of Kylo and Nifi enables data owners to create new data
feeds [@hid-sp18-408-TeradataKylo].
