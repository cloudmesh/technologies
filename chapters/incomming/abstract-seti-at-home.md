After funding was cut SETI lauched SETI$@$Home, a public volunteer
computer via the internet. Using this software users donate idle CPU
time for SETI to do calculations [@hid-sp18-601-www-sathome-about]. It
was released in 1999 and one of its goals was to prove the viability of
volunteer computing. This goal has succeded completly. SETI$@$Home was
inspiration for several similar projects
 [@hid-sp18-601-www-boinc-projects], one of each is the
LHC$@$home [@hid-sp18-601-www-lhc-at-home-history].
