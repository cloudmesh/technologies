Mesosphere is an Datacenter Operating Platform for data-intensive
applications. It is based on the Apache Mesos
kernel [@hid-sp18-404-Concepts2018]. It is a top-level cluster, manager,
container platform and operating system [@hid-sp18-404-Features2018].
Mesosphere performs resource consolidation, resource isolation, and
storage capabilities in a scalable system as it runs distributed
containerized software. It is agnostic to the infrastructure level, and
so can be run on either physical or virtual
machines [@hid-sp18-404-Architecture2018]. Mesosphere incorporates[^1]
with Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
