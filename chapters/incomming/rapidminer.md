RapidMiner is a data science software platform that provides an
integrated environment for data preparation, machine learning and model
deployment into production. It provide the facility to connect to
various sources of different format and different scale to collect the
data, data exploration to discover the pattern in the data, identity the
issues, blending to find the relevant data for the modeling, clean the
data for advanced algorithms. Once the data is prepared models are built
using a nice workflow designer tool. It provides Classification,
regression and clustering techniques. Validation is performed for cross
validation and split validation after the model development for the
accuracy of the model. On the successful validation of the model it is
deployed into production with governance and security. It is Open and
extensible and provide native R and Python support. The source code is
available under an aGPL license. The platform provides an easy drag and
drop environment for easy and fast data science related
operations [@hid-sp18-511-rapidminer].
