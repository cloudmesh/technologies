The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is an open-source project that
can be used for implementing distributed deep learning commercially. Per
Microsoft,

> ``CNTK allows the user to easily realize and combine popular

Under the covers, CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent that are
automatically parallelized across multiple GPUs and
servers [@hid-sp18-510-web-cntk].  As of this date, CNTK can be run on
both Windows and Linux operating systems.
