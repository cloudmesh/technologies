IBM Db2 Big Sql fecilitates operations like accessing data, querying
data and analsying data across data warehouses and also Hadoop.

It is a well formed hybrid engine that lets you get data by querying
Hadoop using SQL. It gives you the flexibilty of having a single
database connection or make queries to different data sources such as


> ``HDFS, RDBMS, NoSql databases, object stores and
> WebHDFS.'' [@IBM; @DB2; @Bi; @Sql]

One of the most important feature
of this Big Sql is that it provides low latency.

This makes data retrival
easier in complex business systems. It also provides high performance,
security, SQL compatibility and federation capabilities to your data
warehouses.

It enables short, rapid queries that facilitates searching by key word
or key ranges. It uses HBase for operations such as point queries and
rapid insert. Workloads can be updated and deleted via this Hbase. To
make use of easier and faster data processing in Apache Spark, it can be
integrated with Spark[@hid-sp18-408-IBMDB2BigSql].
