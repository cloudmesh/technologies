Apache Mahout, an Apache Software Foundation project, is a distributed
Scala DSL based linear algebra framework designed to aid mathematicians,
statisticians and data scientists in implementing their own algorithms
quickly and efficiently [@hid-sp18-510-web-Mahout]. Initiated based on
Andrew Ng et al.'s paper

> "Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on
> Multicore" [@hid-sp18-510-ng-Mahout], it has evolved over time to
> cover other general machine-learning
> approaches [@hid-sp18-510-ibm-Mahout].


While Apache Spark is recommended back end, where core algorithms are
implemented on top of Apache Hadoop, Mahout is also extensible to other
back ends and standalone implementations [@hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout].
While number of algorithms supported by Apache Mahout is increasing, its
core algorithms primarily contain implementations for clustering,
classification, and Collaborative filtering [@hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout].
