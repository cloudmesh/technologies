Oracle NoSQL Database[@hid-sp18-515-www-oraclenosql] is a scalable,
distributed NoSQL database, designed to provide highly reliable,
flexible and available data management across a configurable set of
storage nodes. Data in Oracle NoSQL Database can be modeled as both
relational-database-style tables, JSON documents or key-value pairs.
Based on the hashed value of the primary key, Oracle NoSQL Database is a
sharded s (shared-nothing) system which distributes the data uniformly
across the multiple shards in the cluster. Storage nodes are replicated
to ensure high availability, rapid failover in the event of a node
failure and optimal load balancing of queries within each shard. NoSQL
Database provides Java, C, Python and Node.js drivers and a REST API to
simplify application development. A wide variety of related Oracle and
open source applications are integrated in Oracle NoSQL Database, in
order to simplify and streamline the development and deployment of
modern big data applications. Oracle NoSQL Database is available in the
following editions: Enterprise Edition - Oracle Commercial License Basic
Edition - Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Commercial License
Community Edition - Open source license.
