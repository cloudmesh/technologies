OwnCloud has made its significant impact in providing client-server
software services for creating file hosting services and also to use
them. Even though most of the functionalities are comparable to Dropbox,
OwnCloud distinguishes itself by presenting as an open-source and free
server edition. OwnCloud is easily available which makes any user easy
to install and operate it.

OwnCloud is putting its best efforts to make it work like Google Drive,
providing features such as online document editing, and contact
synchronization [@hid-sp18-406-Owncloud].
