Appscale developed with the objective of releasing, sending and scaling
the Google App Engine applications over the public and private systems
of the cloud, provides the scalable open-source cloud computing. In
addition, appscale also provides the clusters on the same environment
and comprehensive bolster for programming languages such as Go, Java,
PHP, and Python applications. This is enabled with the effective
modeling of the AppScale with the App Engine
APIs [@hid-sp18-412-wiki_appscale].

To enable running applications on any cloud infrastructure Appscale
provides the API-based development environment and quick responsive
functionalities to the designers. The application rationale and the
service system are decoupled from each other in order to effectively
control the application release, data storage, resource utilization,
backup and migration [@hid-sp18-412-wiki_appscale].

Appscale provides a simplified serverless platform for the wide variety
of the web and mobile applications. The enterprises that use this
platform will achieve the goals to quickly manage the time, cut out the
functional costs, improve application stability, and the compatibility
to combine the existing platform with the other novel
technologies [@hid-sp18-412-git_appscale].
