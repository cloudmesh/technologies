Teradata Intellibase
--------------------

Teradata Intellibase provides a compact environment to perform data
warehousing, data exploration in an iterative way and advanced analytics
using the stored data. Storage of data come at a low cost in
Intellibase.

The platform enables a combination of Teradata and Hadoop nodes to make
up for the varied workload requirements. It does this by installing
everything into a single cabinet to preserve the floor space in the data
center.

The features include Teradata Database, Hadoop, Terdata Aster Analytics
and Teradata Unified Data Architecture. With these features, it enables
application deployment in a single cabinet. It also provides advanced
in-memory computing and also provides data protection for all the data
sources. The hardware could be re-deployed elsewhere thereby reducing
infrastructure costs. Additionally, it also provides software re-imaging
for quick replication.

The technology specifications include 18 nodes, 375 TB of uncompresed
data from user and 18TB of memory in a single cabinet. The processors
are dual multi-core Intel Xeon
Processors[@hid-sp18-408-TeradataIntellibase].
