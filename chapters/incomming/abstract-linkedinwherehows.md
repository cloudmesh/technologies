LinkedIn WhereHows is a open source project carried out by the LinkedIn
Data team. The project works by creating a central repository and portal
for several important elements of big data systems: the processes,
people, and knowledge around the data [@hid-sp18-405-www-wherehows]. The
repository has captured the status of 50 thousand datasets, 14 thousand
comments, 35 million job executions and related lineage
information [@hid-sp18-405-www-wherehows]. WhereHows integrates with all
LinkedIn data processing environments and extracts metadata before
offering this piece of information through two interfaces: one is a web
application which facilitates functionalities such as navigation,
search, lineage visualization, annotation, discussion, and community
participation; the other is an API endpoint that empowers automation of
other data processes and applications [@hid-sp18-405-www-wherehows]. The
name WhereHows comes from the two fundamental questions related to the
data: *where* is the data, and *how* is it produced and
consumed [@hid-sp18-405-githubwiki-wherehows].
