Hyperledger Burrow [@hid-sp18-414-Behlendorf] is an open sourced
smart-contract interpreter which was built to meet the requirements of
the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Ethereum network has begun to see
growth in the enterprise sector; with well-known companies such as JP
Morgan, Microsoft, Accenture and BP all recently joining the Enterprise
Ethereum Alliance.The importance around interpreting smart contracts
created by Ethereum cannot be understated, as Ethereum has gained a lot
of traction and credibility within the Cryptocurrency community and
currently at the time of writing has a market cap of 82 billion USD only
second to Bitcoin. Because of this widespread adoption of Ethereum, one
of Burrow's claims to fame is that it is the only Apache-licensed
Ethereum VM implementations on the
market. [@hid-sp18-414-Hyperledger_Burrow]
