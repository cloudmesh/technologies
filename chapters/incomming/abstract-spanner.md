Cloud
Spanner revolutionizes database administration and management and makes

It takes
advantages of all critical features of relational database---such as
schemas, ACID transactions, and SQL queries (ANSI 2011) thus reducing
the need of high learning curve for developers who are well proficient
in structured query language.
