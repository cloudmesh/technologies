ELK is one of most powerful and scalable BigData solutions in the
current market and is indeed doing pretty good. It can solve many
challenging problems with respect to indexing, logging, searching,
troubleshooting, storage and reporting.

ELK acronyms three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and
Kibana.

> "Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a
> server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple
> sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a stash
> like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and
> graphs in Elasticsearch" [@hid-sp18-410-ELK-Home-Page].

ELK is one of the most
scalable solutions in field of reporting and indexing where Elastic
search is an indexing and database kind of service and Logstash works
more like a tool for logging everything feeding it to Elastic search for
indexing and storing in the database, while Kibana is a nice GUI that
helps in data visualization and also allows users to build their own
reporting requirements in the Kibana framwork which also provides
flexibility and scalability. Thus Elasticsearch, logstash and Kibana is
a wonderful open source that has collaborated solution for most of
problems dealing with BigData and cloud.
