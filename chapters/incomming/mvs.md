Microsoft Visual Studio (MVS), community edition, is an open source


> ``integrated development interface IDE applicable for the
> development of computer programs, websites, web services, web and
> mobile apps'' [@hid-sp18-415-wikipedia-org].

While the interface consists of
some built-in tools such as code editor, code profiler and integrated
debugger, it also supports plugins dependending on requirements of
visual designer. Javascript, C++, XML, CSS, `.NET` are among some of the
built -in languages for visual studio. But it supports quite a big
number, that is 36 different, types of languages. Python, Ruby, Node.js
and M are some of the languages available by plugins. Multiple instances
with their own set of packages and specific App-id, can be run at the
same time. MVS connects to windows AZURE making it portable for
developers [@hid-sp18-415-wikipedia-org].
