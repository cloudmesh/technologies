Apache Ranger [@hid-sp18-515-www-ranger] is a framework to enable,
monitor and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop
platform. In order to provide comprehensive security across the Apapche
Hadoop ecosystem, the vision with Ranger was designed. The Hadoop
platform can now support a true data lake architecture with the advent
of Apache YARN. In a multitenant environment, Enterprises can
potentially run multiple workloads. Data security within Hadoop needs to
evolve to support multiple use cases for data access, while also
providing a framework for central administration of security policies
and monitoring of user access. Please read the FAQs if you need to
understand how it works over Apache Hadoop components. The followings
are goals of Apache Ranger: 1. Using a central UI or using REST APIs to
centralize security administration to manage all security related tasks.
2. Use Hadoop components/tools to perform fine-grained authorization of
specific operations and/or operations and manage them through central
management tools. 3. Make sure that all Hadoop components authorization
method are standardized. 4. Enhanced support for different authorization
methods, such as role-based access control, attribute-based access
control, etc. 5. Centrally audit user access and management operations
(security-related) in all Hadoop components.
