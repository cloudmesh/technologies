Presto
------

Presto is a SQL query engine developed specially for interactive
analytics. It focuses on large commercial data warehouses with capacity
of gigabytes to petabytes. It is open source and used for distributed
systems. It is compatible with relational as well as NoSQL of data
sources such as Cassandra and Hive [@hid-sp18-502-Presto].

It is being used by big organizations like Facebook to run interactive
queries against their large data warehouses. The main advantage of using
Presto is that it allows to perform analytics on data from different
data sources using single query. This allows data to be combined across
organizations without extra overhead of separate queries for each data
source [@hid-sp18-502-Presto].
