Apache Phoenix
--------------

Apache Phoenix[@hid-sp18-526-www-apache-phoenix] is an open-source
database engine by Apache that works in tandem with Hadoop and HBase.
Because it uses HBase, Phoenix is a noSQL store. The system supports
online transaction processing (OLTP). Using SQL and Java database
connectivity (JDBC), Phoenix allows for queries over millions of rows to
be executed in milliseconds. Phoenix overlays HBase and allows data to
be accessed directly via SQL queries (through JDBC). It allows for
indexing and parallelization to greatly reduce query time. Phoenix is
compatible with the host of Hadoop products such as Spark, Hive, and
MapReduce. Phoenix allows table modifications through DDL (Data
Definition Language) commands. These commands use simple SQL statements
to create or alter tables. Phoenix also uses ACID (Atomicity,
Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.

In order to begin using Phoenix, you must first install java and
download the Phoenix jar file. Phoenix is currently used by many large
corporations such as eBay, Salesforce, and Bloomberg.
