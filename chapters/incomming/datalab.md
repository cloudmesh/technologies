Cloud Datalab [@hid-sp18-504-google-datalab] is an open source tool part
of the Google Cloud Platform suite which focuses on delivering analytic,
machine learning and visualization solutions. Fully integrated with the
Google Platform Suite, Datalab can leverage the data stored in various
other Google solutions ranging from BigQuery and Machine Learning Engine
to Compute Engine and Cloud Storage [@hid-sp18-504-google-datalab]. In
addition to this integration, Cloud Datalab delivers a solution for
developers to generate reports after exploring, transforming, and
visualizing data using Python, SQL, and Javascript. Visualizations are
primarily derived from sources such as Google Charting or
matplotlib [@hid-sp18-504-techcrunch-datalab].

Based on Jupyter [@hid-sp18-504-google-datalab], Datalab utlizes the
existing platform community and supports a 'large number of existing
packages for statistics, machine learning
etc' [@hid-sp18-504-google-datalab]. Developers can also extend this
open source software by forking it. However, it should be noted that
although this is an open source product and is free, cost is a factor
once this is deployed as an App Engine application and cloud services
are utilized [@hid-sp18-504-techcrunch-datalab].
