Clive is an open-source, distributed operating system written in Go by
the Laboratorio De Sistemas at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in
Madrid [@hid-sp18-419-www-clive-lsub]. The design goal is to create an
environment where applications and services can be compiled along with
libraries that permit them to run on bare hardware without a software
stack [@hid-sp18-419-www-clive-lsub2014]. The design is based on Plan 9,
a research system developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s and first
released in 1992[@hid-sp18-419-www-about-plan9], and NIX, a

> ``purely functional package manager'' [@hid-sp18-419-www-about-nix]
> derived from Plan 9 that runs on Linux and Mac OS X.
