The AWS Cognito [@hid-sp18-518-Cognito] service is used to federate your
user registration and their ability to sign into your services. The
solution allows you to easily manage user pools and can integrate with
multiple SDKs like Java, Python, PHP and Ruby. The client application
can be configured to use SAML, OIDC or other backend user directory
services. The service is intended to be used in conjuction with AWS IAM
and STS.
