Apache Samoa, which stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online
Analysis, is a distributed streaming machine learning framework that
contains a programming abstraction for distributed streaming machine
learning algorithms [@hid-sp18-405-www-samoa].

> ``It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on
> several distributed stream processing engines such as Storm, S4, and
> Samza'' [@hid-sp18-405-www-samoa].

Real time analytics can be utilized by
tools like Samoa and allow organizations to react in a timely manner
when problems appear or to detect new trends helping to improve their
performance by obtain useful knowledge from what is happening
now [@hid-sp18-405-bif2015mining-samoa]. Apache Samoa users can develop
distributed streaming ML algorithms once and execute them on multiple
DSPEs (distributed stream processing
engine) [@hid-sp18-405-mor2015samoa-samoa]. In addition, users could
also add new platforms by using the API provided, therefore, the Samoa
project is divided into two different parts, namely: Samoa-API and
Samoa-Platform. By using Samoa-API, developers could develop for Samoa
without worrying about which DSPE is going to be
used [@hid-sp18-405-blog-samoa]. Samoa, written in Java, is open source
under the Apache Software License version 2.0.
