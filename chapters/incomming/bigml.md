BigML [@hid-sp18-504-cloudacad-bigml] is a Machine Learning platform
focused on delivering a wide range of ML solutions, while aiming to
provide a simplified user experience. Considered as a MLaaS, BigML
integrates with most Cloud storage systems in order to load data and
train machine learning models to develop predictive insights. BigML is
also platform-agnostic, and can utilize existing cloud services, such as
'AWS S3, MS Azure, Google Storage, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc' in order
to import data [@hid-sp18-504-cloudacad-bigml]. The BigML platform can
handle machine learning tasks such as classification and regression,
anomoly detction, cluster analysis, association discover, time series,
and topic modeling [@hid-sp18-504-bigml].

The platform also includes a large number of visualizations and offers
both a Web UI and API interfaces to deliver these machine learning
services. The data sets are reusable, and can be used to build a number
of models and ensembles to improve predictive performance. It is also
possible to convert these models into procedural code that is offered in
various different languages and formats [@hid-sp18-504-cloudacad-bigml].
