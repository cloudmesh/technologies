The Cloud Dataproc is a part of Google Cloud Platform services. It is a
efficient, not sophisticated, and well managed cloud service for
companies who running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters as cloud
base. The companies can adopt their cloud system in to the Cloud
Dataproc, and use Google Cloud Platform services to manage data, mine
useful information from data and so on (see an example in Google Cloud
Platform - Big data solutions). It combines with other services in
Google Cloud Platform services to generates a complete cloud service for
dealing with large amount of data size [@GoogleCP_CD].

More than the companies can adopt their own system into the Cloud
Dataproc, which could be more suitable for the company to use, and also,
the Cloud Dataproc also has has many other development tools are
available to use, such as the Google Cloud SDK, some web UI, and RESTFUL
APIs. The richness of the development tools could lower a company cost
significantly [@GoogleCP_CD].
