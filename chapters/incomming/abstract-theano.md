Theano
------

\TODO{ERROR: USE ONLY ASCII}
Theano is a numerical computation library built for Python programming
language. Theano uses Numpy syntax for expressing computations that can
be compiled to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU architectures. Theano
is an open source project and most of the development is primarily
contributed by a machine learning group at the Université de
Montréal [@hid-sp18-510-wiki-theano]. Theano is a Python library that
allows developers to efficiently define, optimize, and evaluate
mathematical expressions including multi-dimensional arrays. Some of the
features of Theano include tight integration with NumPy, transparent use
of a GPU to perform data intensive computations, dynamic C code
generation for evaluating expressions faster and support for extensive
unit testing and self-verification [@hid-sp18-510-web-theano].
