With the size of medical data getting increased exponentially from
petabytes to exabytes rapidly, Google came up with Google Genomics as
extension to Google cloud platform.It helps the life science community
organize the world's genomic information and make it accessible and
useful [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics]. Researchers are able to apply
Google powerful technologies such as Google Search and Maps to securely
store, process, explore, and share large, complex genomics
datasets [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].

> ``Multiple genome repositories data can be processed using Google
> Genomics within seconds as it is backed by Google bigtable and
> Spanner technologies'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].



> ``It is based on open standard from Global Alliance of Genomics and
> Health achieving higher level of interoperability for genomics
> data'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].

It is fully integrated with Google
cloud virtual machine, storage and SQL/NoSQL
databases [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].

> ``It helps analysing Genomic data in real-time with BigQuery, in
> literate programming style with Cloud Datalab, in batch with GATK on
> Google Genomics, with Apache Spark or Cloud Dataflow, or with a Grid
> Engine cluster'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].
