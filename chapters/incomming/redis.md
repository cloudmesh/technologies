REmote DIctionary Server is No SQL database, supports Key value databases 
by mapping its key to type of values. 
Redis is an In-memory No SQL database, as it rely on the main memory 
to store data. It is an open source, and can support all kind of data 
structures similar to other databases including list, strings, ranges, 
bitmaps and many others. 
With in-memory data store feature, helps Redis to provide a high 
performance and faster retrieval of the data[@hid-sp18-520-Redis].

Redis can handle computation for one dimensional or multidimensional 
values[@hid-sp18-520-Redis].

Redis has a feature for clearing the cache data once reached its 
max capacity defined during the configuration. It identifies the 
policies based on the different combination of trends and can be 
appropriately be removed[@hid-sp18-520-RedisModulescac]. 

Redis has the feature named Redis replication which is very useful 
in case of connectivity issues between master and slaves servers, it 
provided the potential for making slaves as replica of master, in cases of 
any connectivity issues between master and slave servers or master server 
is not operational[@hid-sp18-520-RedisModules].
