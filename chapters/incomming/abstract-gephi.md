a different layout for the analysis purpose. Real-time visualization
capability provides analysis by changing graph in real time through data
filtering. Data filtering capability help reduce nodes and edges in the
graph to do drill down analysis or keeping graph in human readable
format. It has statistics and matrix framework which provides social
network analysis and help community detection which is called as
modularity. Gephi has Data Laboratory which allows us data manipulation
as well as data transformation for analysis. It provides data import
capability through various graph file format as well as CSV format. The
export capability provided by Gephi exports graph in pdf and image
format for analysis and presentation. It supports big data to some
extent by processing capability of around 100k data points. It can be
extended using built-in plugin center. It is supported on Windows, Mac
