Another one of the newer developments from Hyperledger, Hyperledger Indy
is all about providing independent digital identities across blockchains
and distributed ledgers. It is a decentralized identity system and its
advantage is that identity management is its sole focus. As Phillip J.
Windley, Ph.D., Chair, Sovrin Foundation states,

> ``Many have proposed distributed ledger technology as a solution,
> however building decentralized identity on top of distributed
> ledgers that were designed to support something else (cryptocurrency
> or smart contracts, for example) leads to compromises and
> short-cuts.'' [@hid-sp18-414-Windley]

This will allow people to securely, quickly and easily share their
authenticated identity with the groups and organizations of their
choosing while providing those organizations with the peace of mind of
knowing who they are dealing with.

As Behlendorf states,

> ``Instead of being an entry in a giant data base, you have your data
> and deal programmatically with different organizations who want to
> check your identity. And companies don't have to store so much
> personal data. They can store a pointer to the
> identity'' [@hid-sp18-414-Behlendor].
