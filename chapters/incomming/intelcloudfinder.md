Intel Cloud finder is an enterprise level solution for choosing cloud
service provider. It helps the customers seeking help for cloud service
providers. It also provides a very good resource for people looking for
a very good performance with decent amount of security in the cloud.
They state that

> ``In the domain of Intel Cloud Technology we have Intel Advanced
> vector expansions, Intel Turbo boost technology and Intel Xeon
> processor but on the security side we have Intel trusted execution
> technology hardware-based protection for the cloud, ensuring a
> secure foundation and protecting applications against malware,
> malicious software, and other attacks'' [@hid-sp18-410-Intel]

looking forward to using this tool for selecting cloud services that
would satisfy personal cloud requirements.

Obviosly we need to wait
until Intel makes this tool open to public as this looks to be
proprietary tool.
