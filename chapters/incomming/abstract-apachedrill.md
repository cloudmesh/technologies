Apache Drill is an open-source framework for distributing computing on
applications handling data-intensive analysis. It is the open-source
parallel to Google Dremel for querying very large datasets. Drill is an
Apache Top-Level [@hid-sp18-404-BlogsApache2014] project which enables
queries to process on many servers at once over multiple datastores.
Drill supports many database systems including MongoDB, Amazon S3, Azure
Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage [@hid-sp18-404-Drill2015] and
storage file formats including Parquet, JSON, CSV, and TSV in
