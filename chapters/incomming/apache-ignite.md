Apache Ignite is an in-memory distributed database, caching, and
processing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming
workloads, delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte
scale [@hid-sp18-501-ApacheIgnite].

Unlike in-memory databases, Apache Ignite works on top of existing
databases and requires no rip-and-replace or any changes to an existing
RDBMS. Users can keep their existing RDBMSs in place and deploy Apache
Ignite as a layer above it. Apache Ignite can even automatically
integrate with different RDBMS systems, such as Oracle, MySQL, Postgres,
DB2, Microsoft SQL and others. This feature automatically generates the
application domain model based on the schema definition of the
underlying database and then loads the data. Moreover, IMDBs typically
only provide a SQL interface while Apache Ignite provides a much wider
ecosystem of supported access and processing paradigms in addition to
ANSI SQL. Apache Ignite supports key/value stores, SQL access,
MapReduce, HPC/MPP processing, streaming/CEP processing and Hadoop
acceleration, all in one well-integrated in-memory data
fabric [@hid-sp18-501-GridGain].
