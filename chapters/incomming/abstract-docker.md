docker
------

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship,
and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs,
or the cloud [@hid-sp18-513-docker]. It is designed to make it easier to
create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers
allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it
needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as
one package. Docker is like a virtual machine but it does not require to
create a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to
use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only
requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the
host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces
the size of the application  [@hid-sp18-513-opensource].
