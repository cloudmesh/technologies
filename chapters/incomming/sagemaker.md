Amazon SageMaker [@hid-sp18-521-Sagemaker] can help users be able to
develop machine learning models in a more streamlined way. It includes
functionality that allows a user to speed up the process of building,
training and deploying their models. To help simplify the building of ML
models, Jupyter notebooks are included which will allow the user to make
it more convenient to explore and visualize training data stored in S3.
The 12 most common machine learning algorithms have also come
pre-installed and configured, as well as the frameworks Tensorflow and
MXNet, with the option of also using your own specific framework. Using
SageMaker to train your models allows you to scale up underlying
infrastructure as needed up based on your storage needs. Automatic
tuning of models is also included. SageMaker also takes advantage of EC2
in order to create highly available and elastic clusters where you can
deploy your model. A/B testing capabilities are built into the product
as well.
