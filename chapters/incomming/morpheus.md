Morpheus provides cloud and hybrid cloud solutions to improve the
efficiency of continuous development and integration life cycles by
focusing on devops and developer perspectives. The analytics offering of
Morpheus focuses on optimizing resource allocations on VM environments,
such as containers and public clouds, that distributes over multiple
clouds with platform independent discovery services. The competitive
edge that the Morpheus has over other VM boost up package vendors is the
Analytics' ability to visualize platform wide resource consumptions. The
Analytics pack uses either built in cloud APIs or specific agents to
gather resource consumption information across all the platforms and
does the brokerage of incoming requests to minimize the incurring
resource consumption costs [@hid-sp18-416-www-morpheus-product-guide].

Morpheus governance tool provides the ability to index, categorize and
store enterprise artifacts and provide life cycle management of the
artifacts. The integrated Role Based Access Control (RBAC) makes sure
that the artifacts are accessible only to the authorized people and
provides them with the ability to view certain aspects of the artifacts.
The artifacts could be anything that comes under the hood of SOA
governance [@hid-sp18-416-www-soa-governance-wikipedia] and they are
managed by the policies defined and uploaded by the authorized roles in
the system.
