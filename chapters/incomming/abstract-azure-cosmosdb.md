Azure Cosmos DB
---------------

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally-distributed data service that allows
elastically scaling throughput and storage across any number of
geographical regions while guaranteeing low latency, high availability
and consistency [@hid-sp18-501-CosmosDB]. It can support multiple data
models using one backend. This means that it can be used for document,
key value, relational, and graph models. It is more or less a NoSQL
database because it does not rely on any schemas. However, because it
uses query language similar to SQL and can easily support ACID
transactions, some people have been classifying it as a NewSQL type of
database. What differentiates it from other NewSQL databases, however,
is that it does not have a relational data
model [@hid-sp18-501-Stackify]
