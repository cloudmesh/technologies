Orange [@hid-sp18-504-orange] is a data mining, visualization, and
machine learning toolkit based on Python 3. This software is developed
in such a way as to allow practitioners to have varying degrees of
technical background (including complete novices) and still utilize the
product's capabilities [@hid-sp18-504-orange], Orange has an interactive
data visualization interface which allows for a simpler approach to
perform complex data mining and machine learning practices and to derive
insightful knowledge. Orange also provides a visual programming
component in the form of widgets to perform qualitative analysis through
a visualized workflow map. Depending on a widget's function, it is then
grouped into a class, encouraging the use of various widgets in a
typical given workflow. These widget visualizations also assist in the
communication of analytic processes between domain experts and data
scientists, which has encouraged the use of this product in academic and
research settings [@hid-sp18-504-orange]; particularly with domains
involving 'biomedicine, bioinformatics, \[and\] genomic
research' [@hid-sp18-504-wiki-orange].

This open source toolkit's latest version (3+) uses various python
libraries for computation, while utilizing the Qt framework for the
visualization end [@hid-sp18-504-wiki-orange]. The available Python
classes and methods include classes based on data models, preprocessing,
classification, regression, clustering, distance, evaluation, and
projection. The classification and regression classes offer the largest
number of available methods, such as random forests, Naive Bayes, neural
networks, and k-nearest neighbors [@hid-sp18-504-orange]. These classes
can either be used directly as a Python library, or used in Orange's
widget sets. It is also possible to create custom widgets and include
them in an Orange workflow [@hid-sp18-504-wiki-orange].
