HCatalog, which was originally known as Howl, is a component shipped
with Hive that manages storage and tables. Its purpose is to simplify
data storage and retrieval by providing a shared schema and data type
mechanism between Hive, Pig, and MapReduce and the formats in which a
Hadoop serializer-deserializer can be written (ORC, RCFile, CSV, JSON,
and SequenceFile.) Custom formats can be added as well. A REST API
called WebHCat (originally Templeton) is also
available [@hid-sp18-419-www-hc-wiki].
