Apache Solr is an open-source search platform used to build search
applications. It leverages the power of Apache
Lucene [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-lucene], which is a Java-based search
library providing the core operations required by any search application
like Indexing and Searching [@hid-sp18-516-www-tutorialspoint-solr].
Apache Lucene and Apache Solr were merged together in 2010 and since
then, produced by the Apache Software Foundation development team. It
has an active development community and regular releases. Solr has
RESTful API's like HTTP/XML [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-xml] or
JSON [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-json] to communicate with it that can be
used from most popular programming
languages [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-solr]. It has all capabilities
required for a full-text search server such as tokens, spell check,
wildcard, phrases and auto-complete. It is fast, highly scalable,
reliable, fault-tolerant and enterprise-ready and can be deployed in any
kind of systems such as standalone, distributed or
cloud [@hid-sp18-516-www-tutorialspoint-solr]. Other major features
include hit highlighting, built-in security, distributed search through
sharding, database integration, faceted search, rich document (e.g.,
Word, PDF) handling [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-solr]. As Hadoop can handle
large amounts of data, Solr can be used with
Hadoop [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-hadoop] to find the required information
from a large source. Apart from search, Solr also has
NoSQL [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-nosql] features and it can be used as a
non-relational data storage and processing technology. The components of
Solr can be customized easily by extending and configuring its Java
classes thereby making it flexible and
extensible [@hid-sp18-516-www-tutorialspoint-solr]. Solr provides
navigation features to world's largest internet sites like Netflix,
Instagram, Best Buy, eBay etc. [@hid-sp18-516-www-apacheorg-solr]. It is
packaged as the built-in search in many applications such as content
management systems and enterprise content management
systems [@hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-solr].
