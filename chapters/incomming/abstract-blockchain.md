Blockchain
----------

A blockchain is a continuously growing list of linked records, called
blocks. The most recent transactions are recorded and added to it in
chronological order, it allows the public to keep track of all
transactions in the chain without central recordkeeping. Each computer
participating in the blockchain gets a copy of the data which is
downloaded automatically.

Blockchains are decentralized by design and provide a new level of the
way we trust data. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is
typically managed by a peer-to-peer network on the internet collectively
agreeing to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the
data in any given block cannot be changed. One computer trying to tamper
a record would have to beat all the computers in the network that are
verifying the transactions. Thus tampering is very close to
impossibility.

Alhough, the popular use of blockchain nowadays is with the generation
of cryptocurrency, blockchain has more to offer. Big corporations as
well the government Institutions have been realizing the potential of
the blockchain technology. Recently, the US Department of Health
sponsored a contest to the public to propose how can blockchain be used
to help improve the health care systems of the country. IBM is looking
into how to integrate blockchain in the food industry. Microsoft has
partnered with Accenture to use blockchain to store who don't have any
form of identification and there are billions of them in the world.
Blockchain is here to stay.
