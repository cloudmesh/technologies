Pig is a part of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem consisting of a scripting
language called Pig Latin and a compiler that produces Map-Reduce
programs. It was initially developed in 2006 at Yahoo! and taken over by
Apache in 2007[@hid-sp18-419-die2015datascience]. Pig Latin allows
developers to code multiple interrelated data transformations as data
flow sequences, with the goal fo making the code readable and easy to
maintain. Pig optimized Pig Latin automatically and users can extend the
language with purpose-written functions[@hid-sp18-419-www-pig]. There is
some overlap in functionality between Pig and Hive, an SQL-like language
that is also a part of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. Pig tends to be
favored by programmers and researchers, whereas Hive is preferred by
data analysts[@hid-sp18-419-www-dezyre-pig].
