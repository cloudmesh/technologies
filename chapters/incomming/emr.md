Amazon EMR [@hid-sp18-521-AmazonEMR] is a Hadoop framework that allows
the user to process data on the AWS platform using their EC2 technology
to spread the load across multiple EC2 instances. Elasticity a major
benefit of this product as it can be set to auto scale up or down the
number of EC2 instances that EMR is running in a cluster. The user can
choose to run a few additional frameworks supported on EMR in addition
to Hadoop, such as Spark, HBase, Flink and Presto. It allows the user to
focus on the processing of the data and not have to deal with the setup,
management or tuning of a Hadoop cluster. Using EMR allows a user to
setup and provision a Hadoop cluster quickly and you can scale your
compute resources up or down as needed. You can interact with EMR
through a web service interface or you can also use the AWS Management
Console to launch and monitor your clusters.
