The world bank is a philanthropic organization that has two main goals.  First,
end extreme poverty and second, to promote shared prosperity.  One of the ways
the World Bank hopes to meet its goals is by developing and sharing an
open-data platform that can be used by the public.  The World Bank hopes the
open data platform can be used to promote knowledge that will ultimately help
with its goal of promoting prosperity and ending extreme poverty~\cite{hid-sp18-505-Bank2018}.
