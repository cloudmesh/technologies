\section{Apache Whirr}

Apache Whirr provides collection of libraries for running cloud
services in a neutral way. Whirr began as a set of shell scripts for
running Hadoop on Amazon EC2, and later matured to include a Java API
based on the Apache jclouds project.

It defines the layout of clusters, It also has scripts to run
operations to start, stop and terminate new
clusters~\cite{hid-sp18-421-whirrCloud}.
