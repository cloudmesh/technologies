Apache Kylin is an Online analytical processing or OLAP engine developed
specially for Big Data applications. Analysts around the world today use
SQL interfaces to query data from traditional database systems, Kylin
fits in well due to this as it provides SQL interface as well as OLAP
capability for Hadoop ecosystem which no other tool provides today.
Kylin is very efficient and can return billions of rows in minimum time.
It integrates well other BI tools such as Tableau. Kylin is rich in
features and provides, incremental refresh of cubes, web interface for
monitoring and management and ldap integration as well. Since Kylin was
specially built for Hadoop and big data applications, it depends on some
of the components such as HBase, Hive and HDFS. HBase is used to store
the data cube, map reduce does the cube refresh or partial refresh job
and HDFS stores intermediate files during cube building
process [@hid-sp18-517-ApacheKylin].
