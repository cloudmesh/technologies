The most notable synthetic data generator is the Synthetic Data Vault
(SDV)[@hid-sp18-526-patki-sdv]. Developed at MIT by Neha Patki, Roy
Wedge, and Kalyan Veeramachaneni, the Synthetic Data Vault uses machine
learning techniques to model database structure and content. The models
can then be used to generate entirely synthetic tables and relationships
which are true to the form of the originals. Because the synthetic data
is generated and modeled mathematically according to the original data,
very little, if any, insight is lost. Here we will explore why we should
use synthetic data, how SDV generates synthetic data, and how to use the
data generated by SDV.

SDV is written in Python and is, therefore, cross-platform. A separate
file is required for each database in the table. Also, each database
requires a configuration file in json format. The specifications for the
configuration file will be shown later, but first we will discuss why
such a product is necessary.
