HBase
-----

Apache HBase[@hid-sp18-515-www-hbase]is a distributed, scalable, big
data store, Hadoop database. You can use Apache HBase when you need
random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. The goal of HBase
is hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of
columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is modeled
after Google's Bigtable, which is a Distributed Storage System for
Structured Data. HBase is an open source, non-relational distributed
database that mimics Google's Bigtable and is written in Java. It was
developed as part of the Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop
project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System),
providing Hadoop with similar Bigtable functionality. HBase provides
compression, in-memory operations, and Bloom filters for each column
listed in the original Bigtable file. HBase does not directly replace
the traditional SQL database, but the Apache Phoenix project provides
SQL layers for HBase and JDBC drivers that can be integrated with a
variety of analytics and business intelligence applications.
