Ripple Transaction Protocol is an open-source protocol that allows
transfer of anything of value (usually payments) on the internet.

There are 3 problems that ripple are trying to solve in the current
payment systems available now high fees, charges for currency exchanges
and processing delays.

Banks today built their own system for their customers that dont easily
interact with each other. The Ripple network is designed to connect
different payment systems together.

With ripple the transaction fees are very minimal and comparative less
than what for example Visa charges. And there are no foreign exnchanges
loses since the the currency is never converted to any other currency
from the source to the destination. The transfer is also completed
within minutes compared to the usual 3-business-days waiting period when
sending money thru the traditional means.
