Synthea [@hid-sp18-526-www-synthea] is an open-source medical patient
generator. Synthea allows for the full synthetic generation of medical
patients and patient records, which solves the privacy problems of using
real-world patient data. It also allows medical researchers to generate
data on-demand and test scaling, stress, etc. Synthea uses a Generic
Model Framework (GMF) to model and track disease progression as well.
Each patient generated by Synthea is a full-model: from birth to present
with full demographics. This type of data can be used for small and
large-scale health analysis. The data underlying these models are
generated based on current academic research. Therefore, the data can
also be used to run analysis on the synthetic patients.

According to its website, Synthea is useful for Academic Research, the
Health IT Industry, and Policy Formation. Synthea is a product of
MITRE Corporation written in Java, and supports both C-CDA and FHIR
formats. It can also generate graphs using Graphviz.
