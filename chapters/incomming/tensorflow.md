TensorFlow provides a platform for implementing and execute machine 
learning algorithms and is highly popular with deep neural network 
models and algorithms. TensorFlow is cross-platform, it can support 
mobile and embedded platforms. It has lot of API to support complex 
computations and algorithms. The famous computation in on the 
numeric data and generate the data flow graphs. TensorFlow has many 
powerful APIs which provides the ease with implementation of any 
model across any platforms, it can be implemented on a server, mobile 
or desktop with ease and less configuration due to these powerful 
APIs. Google Brain team developed TensorFlow and gave a new way for 
researches using machine learning and deep learning algorithms 
[@hid-sp18-520-TensorFlow].
Model built using TensorFlow, can have lot of computations and steps 
before it produces the respective output for classification or 
prediction or any results for Deep learning algorithms and can be 
tedious to follow all the steps and calculations. TensorFlow provides 
an a visualization of all these calculation and steps using a tool 
named TensorBoard. It can be used for visualizing graphs, or can be 
used for plotting data in the graph [@hid-sp18-520-TensorFlowboard].
