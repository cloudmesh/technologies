TensorFlow provides a platform for implementing machine learning 
algorithms and is highly preferred with deep neural network models 
and algorithms. Google Brain team[hid-sp18-520-TensorFlowWiki] 
developed TensorFlow. TensorFlow is cross-platform, it can support 
mobile and embedded platforms and facilitates with APIs to support 
complex computations such as computation on the numeric data and 
generate the data flow graphs. TensorFlow has many powerful APIs 
which provides the ease with implementation of any model across 
any platforms, it can be implemented on a server, mobile 
or desktop with less configuration[@hid-sp18-520-TensorFlow].
TensorFlow provides high level API for training and build models such as
Keras, Eager Execution, Estimators and Importing Data
[@hid-sp18-520-TensorFlowhlapi].

Tensors represents the data in Tensorflow, which are multidimensional 
arrays. Model built using TensorFlow, can have lot of computations and 
steps before it produces the respective output for classification or 
prediction or any results for Deep learning algorithms and can be 
tedious to follow all the steps and calculations. TensorFlow provides 
a visualization of data flow of all these calculation and steps within 
TensorBoard suite. In dataflow graph, the nodes are mathematical operations
and connecting edges provides the details on the data transferred from 
one node to other node[@hid-sp18-520-TensorFlowboard].
