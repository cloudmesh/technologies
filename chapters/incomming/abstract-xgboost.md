XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting. Before talking about
XGBoost, it is best to give introduction to general gradient boosting.
Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique used to build both
regression and classification models. It is primarily used in building
decision trees. But building gradient boosting models on huge datasets
(that sometimes contain more than 500,000 observations) is
computationally onerous, not so efficient.

> algorithms. Which is the reason why many people use xgboost''.

- says Tianqi Chen, creator of XGBoost
(later received contributions from many
developers) [@hid-sp18-401-XGBoost-gen]. The description of XGBoost
according to the software repository on github is
