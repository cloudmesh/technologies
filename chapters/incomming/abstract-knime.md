KNIME
-----

KNIME Analytics Platform [@hid-sp18-504-pred-knime] (otherwise known as
Konstanz Information Miner) is an open source platform focused on
including machine learning components, data mining, analytics, and
reporting; all executed through an interactive visual interface
displaying modules linked together through a pipeline workflow. These
modules are made up of data analytic routines which are comprised of
either R, Weka, or KNIME's own native routines. Since coding is optional
through KNIMEs graphical interface [@hid-sp18-504-knime], workflows can
be created to represent the individual steps in a dataflow, and allows
the user to execute these steps selectively and view their output
throughout different stages of their
workflow [@hid-sp18-504-pred-knime].

KNIME can allow for the use of additional extentions and plugins since
it's java based and built on Eclipse. In additional KNIME supports
common dbms as data sources [@hid-sp18-504-pred-knime]. Extensions
available to KNIME also include Big Data Extensions to utilize
computational resources from sources such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, and
the KNIME Server. KNIME also allows the ability to blend various data
sources, such as databases, images, text files, XML, JSON, networks, and
Hadoop data, to be included in the same pipeline workflow and provide
data and tool blending capabilities [@hid-sp18-504-knime].
