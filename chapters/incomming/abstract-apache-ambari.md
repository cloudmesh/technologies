Apache Ambari
-------------

Ambari is a software to manage Hadoop environment efficiently by
providing services like managing, monitoring and provisioning to the
hadoop clusters [@hid-sp18-401-wiki-Ambari].

When Apache Hadoop started developing with aim of increasing its
scalability, several application layers started to cover its
architecture like Pig, Hive, HBase etc. making the management of Hadoop
architecture bulky and unmanageable, and several problems were faced by
the developers in handling large hadoop clusters. Ambari is developed
aiming to be the solution to the above problems.

Apache architecture includes two main components - Ambari Server and
Ambari Agent. Ambari supports 64 bit OS like RHEL 5 (Redhat enterprise
Linux), RHEL 6, CentOS 5, CentOS 6 etc [@hid-sp18-401-Ambari]. Ambari
provided monitoring services through tools like Dashboard views - which
shows cluster health and cluster status, also by collecting different
metrics like Job status, Maps slots utilization, garbage collection.
