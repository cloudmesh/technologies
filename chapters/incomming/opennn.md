OpenNN is a collection of functions developed for research work in field of 
Deep learning and deployment of neural network. OpenNN is an open 
source library. Development of OpenNN libraries were using C++ programming 
language, which provided a benefit of low memory usage and high performance 
with less computation time. 

With multiprocessing, shared memory and Graphics processing units 
accelerations used for computing multiple calculations simultaneously, which
provides programs to have CPU parallelism and result in better and faster 
computation. OpenNN provides algorithms for data mining in form of libraries 
and functions, which are utilized with data mining and predictive modeling
[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN]. 

OpenNN libraries and functions are integrated with analytical tool, such as 
Neural Designer[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNNnw] which provides a UI interface for 
users. This provide the ease of visualization for the users, to do any data 
entry tasks or once the model is created and output is generated, can provide 
results interpretation[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN].

With OpenNN, the neural network is establishing multilayer perceptron, which 
describes the count of neurons and their respective connectivity. OpenNN 
model can be enhanced with scaling or unscaling, where the layer can exist 
with basic statistics of mean, standard deviations, minimum or maximum 
values of the input or output variables[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNNn].
