With many companies contributing to the growth of the platform, over 159
engineers from 28 different organizations, there is a promising future
for the platform as a variety of businesses begin to explore building
products with Fabric. As stated by Behlendorf the number of projects
already being built is in high hundreds to low
thousands. [@hid-sp18-414-Behlendorf_Interview]. As distributed ledger
technology continues to grow, the willingness for enterprises across
differing industry/sectors to contribute to this open source platform is
key to it's success.
