Cascading is an open source data processing project started in early
2008. Cascading functions as a work flow workhorse within the Apache
Hadoop platform and serves as an alternative API to MapReduce. The
Cascading Ecosystems includes multiple project extensions for
compatibility with multiple languages, platforms, and
functions [@hid-sp18-507-CascadingEco]. Originally written in Java, the
Cascading platform can be run on any JVM and includes extensions for
application development using Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) such as
Python, Ruby, Scala or Clojure [@hid-sp18-507-GitHubCascading].
Cascading and the Cascading ecosystem were originally designed to be
used with the Apache Hadoop MapR distribution for the purpose of
developing data-rich applications with analysis and machine learning
capabilities [@hid-sp18-507-MapR].The open source platform an all
extensions are available through the Apache Public License.
