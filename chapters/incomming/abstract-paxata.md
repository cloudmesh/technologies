One of the most important and time consuming job of data scientist is to
clean and prepare data from multiple sources in a format that it can be
analyzed. Paxata [@hid-sp18-413-paxata] semi automates the process by
using its own algorithms. It uses machine learning and text mining
combined with its libraries to efficiently clean data. Paxata provides a
spreadsheet like interface where inconsistencies are color coded and
instructions are provided to clean up data. Paxata visualizes the data
in form of graphs and creates associations between various data objects
and uses them to resolve data quality issues. This data can then be
consumed by visualizing softwares like tableau. With this approach
Paxata gives anyone ability to run data analytics on big data sets in a
short amount of time.
