Hyperledger Iroha is an open source, mobile focused blockchain platform.
The Japanese startup, Soramitsu in partnership with Hitachi started the
initiative to create a mobile friendly blockchain architecture. As one
of the new, up and coming Hyperledger projects it focuses on being
simple and easy to include in projects and was implemented in C++ which
allows it to,

As stated by the Linux Foundation,

> ``Hyperledger Iroha is designed to be simple and easy to incorporate
> into infrastructural projects that require distributed ledger
> technology. It features a simple construction, modern, domain-driven
> C++ design, emphasis on mobile application development and a new,
> chain-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, called
> Sumeragi'' [@hid-sp18-414-Active_Status_Iroha].
