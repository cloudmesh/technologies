OrientDB is NoSQL database, which supports graph engines and it can be 
implemented as document database or as an Object-Oriented database 
[@hid-sp18-520-OrientDB]. With Document database, it stores the documents 
as Key and value pairs. It refers group of these documents as collections. 
In OrientDB, classes or clusters are similar to Tables and every documents 
are similar to rows when compared with relational database models. 
With Graph databases, it creates the nodes known as Vertex and arcs known 
as Edges for storing the data. Vertex are equivalent to rows in relational 
database. Vertex and Edges properties are similar to the columns in 
relational database. It supports SQL as the built in query language. SB Tree
[@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBgraphI] is default indexing mechanism implemented with 
OrientDB for optimizing  inserting of data and range queries.
Reference and Embeded relationship is supported by OrientDB, where 
relationship with object is stored as direct links or the relationship is 
stored in the record itself[@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBconcepts].

Graph databases are useful for developing application related to social 
networking and establish relationships between objects with respect to there 
properties. It maintains class relation using documents and links in document 
model [@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBgraph].
