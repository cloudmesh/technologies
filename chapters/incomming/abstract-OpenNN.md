> ``OpenNN is an open source class library written in C++ programming
> language which implements neural networks, a main area of machine
> learning research. The main advantage of OpenNN is its high
> performance.  It is developed in C++ for better memory management
> and higher processing speed, and implements CPU parallelization. The
> library implements any number of layers of non-linear processing
> units for supervised learning. This deep architecture allows the
> design of neuralnetworks with universal approximation
> properties'' [@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN].



> ``Neural Designer has been developed from OpenNN, which is a
> advanced analytical tool and contains a graphical user interface
> which simplifies data entry and interpretation of
> results'' citehid-sp18-520-OpenNN.


> ``The class of neural network implemented in OpenNN is based on the
> multilayer perceptron. That model is extended here to contain
> scaling, unscaling, bounding, probabilistic and conditions
> layers'' [@hid-sp18-520-OpenNNn].


> ``OpenNN includes project files for Qt Creator. When working with
> another compiler is needed,a project for it must be
> created'' [@hid-sp18-520-OpenNNb].
