To make Hadoop deployment enterprise-class, easy data replication is
required to support critical business applications that depend on
Hadoop. Keeping this in mind, IBM created IBM Big Replicate which does
class replication for Hadoop and object store.

The main features of the product include continuous availability, high
performance with guaranteed data consistency. Also, it replicates large
amounts of data from lab to production environment, from production to
disaster recovery sites. These replications are governed by the business
rules set up. This technology replicates data as the data streams in.
Thus, it reduces dependency on completion of file operation i.e.,
closing of file before data can be transferred. It offers replication in
a flexible way by handling various Hadoop ditributions and verisons.
Additionally, for each cluster, multiple IBM Big Replicate can be
deployed as proxy servers to add resilience. Users can access Hadoop
Distributed File System using Big Replicate via the standard HDFS
URI [@hid-sp18-408-IBMBigReplicate].
