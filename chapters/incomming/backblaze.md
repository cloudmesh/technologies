Backblaze is a cloud backup service [@hid-sp18-601-www-bblaze-about],
providing solutions to business [@hid-sp18-601-www-bblaze-business] and
private users [@hid-sp18-601-www-bblaze-personal]. Backblaze plans do
not have a limit for the amount of data you can backup and the software
continuously uploads data present on your device.

If the backup is ever needed it can be downloaded. For cases were the
amount of data is to much to be downloaded Backblaze offers a service to
mail a encripted flash drive or hard drive instead.
