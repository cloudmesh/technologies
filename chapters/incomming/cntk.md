The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is an open-source project that
can be used for implementing distributed deep learning commercially. Per
Microsoft,

Under the covers, CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent that are
automatically parallelized across multiple GPUs and
servers [@hid-sp18-510-web-cntk].  As of this date, CNTK can be run on
both Windows and Linux operating systems.
