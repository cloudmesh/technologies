## Format

The format of the entries are rather simple. Here is a
sample entry:

```
## Technology Name


|          |                        |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| title    | Technology Name        | 
| status   | 0                      |
| section  | TBD                    |
| keywords | workflow, python       |


Here will be a text describing in meaningful but brief
fashion what the technology is about and how it is
used. refernces are includes with breackers and the at
sign as well as a label. The entry must be included in
a bibliography file in the bib directory. you must make
sure that the entry is not duplicated, either in the
label or the content
[@hid-sp18-000-www-technology-name]. To avoid
duplication in the label, we ask you to add your hid in
case you take a class with us, or your github id in
case you just like to contribute withoput taking a
class.

> ``This is a word by word quote from the
> citation. Please note the > and the special
> quotes. do not use a " to quote, as we use the begin
> and end quote for formatting purposes''
> [@hid-sp18-000-www-technology-name].

```

Please keep the following siomple rules in mind. If we
forgot a rule that could be helpful to you, let us know.

1. It is important that you do not just paste and copy,
   but that the entry you provide uses proper quotation
   rules and does not plagiarize. It is in your
   responsibility to assure this is the case.  If you
   just paste and copy we rather like not to recieve
   your contribution. Naturally if you are the author of
   the technology, you certainly can paste, but in case
   you do a class you will not be able to do so.
2. Any entry will be rejected if it uses the words
   *below*, *above*, *left*, and *right* to refer to
   descriptions in your text.  Electronic
   publicates are relativeand terms such as below, and
   above make no sense.
3. Any figure that is copied from a source and does not
   have a caotion and does not have a citation within
   the caption
4. Please create separate pull requests for each
   technology that you add or modify. We will reject all
   pull requests that try to fix multiple entries. THis
   is done in order to make reviews easier
5. The technology must be preceeded by  `##` and not
   just `#`

Once you have updated your technology, do not forget to
put a `:new:` emoji in your title of the
technology. This indicates to us that you like your
technology to be reviewed. If it is still under
construction use the emoji `:construction:`. This
indicates to us that you have worked on it, but are not
yet redy for review. In case you are seeing some issue
with someones technology, you are allowe dto mark it
with the emoji `:hand:`. THis will indicate than that
others may need to look at it. ALso provide comments if
you can.

The emojis are

|      |      |
| ---- | ---- |
| :new: |  ready to be reviewed and graded |
| :hand: | technology needs improvement |
| :construction: | actively worked on by you |
| :o: | do not remove |
|     | indicates review by us needed due to issue|
|     | you should improve it |
