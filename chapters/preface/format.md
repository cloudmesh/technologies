## Format

The format of the entries are rather simple. Here is a
sample entry:

```
## Technology Name


|          |                        |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| title    | Technology Name        | 
| status   | 0                      |
| section  | TBD                    |
| keywords | workflow, python       |


Here will be a text describing in meaningful but brief
fashion what the technology is about and how it is
used. References are included with brackets and the at
sign as well as a label. The entry must be included in
a bibliography file in the bib directory. you must make
sure that the entry is not duplicated, either in the
label or the content
[@hid-sp18-000-www-technology-name]. To avoid
duplication in the label, we ask you to add your hid in
case you take a class with us, or your github id in
case you just like to contribute without taking a
class.

> "This is a word by word quote from the
> citation. Please note the > and the special
> quotes. do not use a " to quote, as we use the begin
> and end quote for formatting purposes"
> [@hid-sp18-000-www-technology-name].

```

Please keep the following simple rules in mind. If we
forgot a rule that could be helpful to you, let us know.

1. It is important that you do not just paste and copy,
   but that the entry you provide uses proper quotation
   rules and does not plagiarize. It is in your
   responsibility to assure this is the case.  If you
   just paste and copy we rather like not to receive
   your contribution. Naturally if you are the author of
   the technology, you certainly can paste, but in case
   you do a class you will not be able to do so.
2. Any entry will be rejected if it uses the words
   *below*, *above*, *left*, and *right* to refer to
   descriptions in your text.  In an Electronic
   publications terms usch as as below, and
   above make no sense.
3. Any figure that is copied from a source and does not
   have a citation and does not have a citation within
   the caption
4. Please create separate pull requests for each
   technology that you add or modify. We will reject all
   pull requests that try to fix multiple entries. THis
   is done in order to make reviews easier
5. The technology must be proceeded by  `##` and not
   just `#`
6. Do not forget that markdown as we use it requires to 
   use proper quotes and not quotes that are used by editors 
   such as Word. So use straight single and double quotes. 
   To *highlight* a word use italics instead of quotes. 
   Quotes are `"` and `'`. You can paste them form here and 
   use.
7. When using references such as Web pages use a `www-` as prefix. Other
   prefixes are `blog-`, `wiki-`, `youtube-`.

Once you have updated your technology, do not forget to
put a `:smiley:` emoji in your title of the
technology. This indicates to us that you like your
technology to be reviewed. If it is still under
construction use the emoji `:construction:`. This
indicates to us that you have worked on it, but are not
yet redy for review. In case you are seeing some issue
with someones technology, you are allowed to mark it
with the emoji `:hand:`. THis will indicate than that
others may need to look at it. Also provide comments if
you can.

The emojis are

|      |      |
| ---- | ---- |
| :smiley: |  ready to be reviewed and graded |
| :new: |  ready to be reviewed and graded, same as :smiley: |
| :hand: | technology is picked by someone and is actively worked on |
| :wave: | A reviewer suggests improvements |
| :construction: | actively worked on by you |
| :o: | this entry needs improvements |
